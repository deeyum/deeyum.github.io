My friend Sundar named these vignettes, taken together, as "pessimism poetry." I told him these word pictures were merely exercises in crafting succinct images of  sudden and unexpected developments in people's lives. Such things do happen, do they not?  People are writing stories these days in a single "tweet" of 140 characters. The number of characters in the above stories is shown in parentheses. Perhaps the stories could be told in even fewer words, even fewer lines. As such, each vignette is roughly "half a tweet" in length or shorter.

The one below has only 46 characters:

Rajat Gupta

IIT
Harvard
McKinsey
Goldman Sachs
Then
Preet Bharara (46)
