Apparently the DDOS attack this time was particularly vicious, so it felt good, when I opened up LJ just now, to have my favourite blog back! LJ people, thanks for the work you've put in to stave off the attack.

I've already made some posts in WordPress, and will now be posting them here, too, but the latest nice news is that my letter has been published in the Missouri Conservationist... 


This is an excellent magazine, with superb articles and photos, that appears monthly. In St.Louis I have subscribed to this magazine, and wrote to them about my appreciation. and they printed the letter!

One day, one of my photographs will also get published there.... :)))
