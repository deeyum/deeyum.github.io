I wanted to post this on Metblogs, but the page I get doesn't have a link that will let me post (Metblogs was re-designed recently and I guess they still have glitches!)


So here's a delightful scene I snapped last Saturday in Lalbagh:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2316999279/" title="women's conference lalbagh 010308 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2316999279_159228f57b_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="women's conference lalbagh 010308" /></a>


Are those women picnicking in the park? (Couldn't see if there was food inside the circle.) Do they have a more serious agenda? What could have brought so many of them to the park, so early in the morning? I preferred not to go up and ask, and leave explanations to my imagination...


Here's to women everywhere. I don't say we are always the angels that all those internet forwards talk about; we are human, we have our vices and failings, too...but in general, it's a sisterhood that I am proud to belong to, and here's wishing for the day when each woman will be able to realize her full potential.....when gender will not be an issue worth discussing, and we don't have to have a special Women's Day, because every day will be one.


I have now successfully put this up on Metblogs, too...!
