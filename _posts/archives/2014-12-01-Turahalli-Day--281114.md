For some years now, we've been celebrating 

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/362792720545679/"> Turahalli Habba, or Festival, or Day </a>

 just to register the presence of those who love this patch of forest, and want to prevent any more encroachment

Here's the 

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TurahalliTrails"> FB page </a>

A group of us decided to do the bird walk, and here we are, at the MCS before heading out to Turahalli:

Light gathered in the sky:

I spotted this little gem on the side of the road:

<lj user="prashanthchengi"> tells me it is a Dodge Truck from the 40's...

"The grille is very distinctive. Don't know the exact model, but it sure seems similar to 

<a href="http://assets.hemmings.com/story_image/357461-1000-0.jpg"> this </a> "

he says. Indeed it seems to be the same!

We arrived a bit late, thanks to some befuddling GPS, but still got the rising sun:

At Turahalli, a lot of activities were going on.

There were rock climbers:

There were people just enjoying the peace:

Some were sharing their knowledge:

Some were collecting trash, and laughing about their "spoils"!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15886998906" title="IMG_6253 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8666/15886998906_e17a24a9be_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6253"></a>

It was good to see far less trash than before, and even more heartening to see children collecting it, too:

There was cycling:


It was good to see adult and children's cycles!

We opened our "birding account" on the way to Turahalli with this female

KESTREL:

MBK pointed out this 

PEACOCK

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15726762389" title="IMG_6241 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7512/15726762389_d465dd9db7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6241"></a>

but later the butterfly group

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15725324058" title="IMG_6254 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7542/15725324058_482a7351a6_z.jpg" width="640" height="467" alt="IMG_6254"></a>

 told us that some people were trying to poach these birds by setting the dogs on to them. I have made a complaint to the Forest Dept, and am hoping for more active surveillance.

A 

SOUTHERN COUCAL

skulked through the trees, but we were able to see it.

A delightful

CLERODENDRUM

greeted us:

The butterfly group got 50 species! Here's a

COMMON CROW:

I found this dead

FRUIT-PIERCING MOTH:

I saw a

YELLOW PANSY:

It was not nice, though, to see the loooong line of cars which had come for the event...but I suppose it can't be helped!

Naturally, there is a huge block of buildings coming up right opposite, with this as the selling point:

Of course, some of us finished with a good breakfast at Adiga's:

On the way back home, I was wondering if I could hire this silver chariot!

I've put up more photos on my FB album,

We hope the sun always shines on an undisturbed patch of Turahalli Forest:
