<DIV align=center><FONT face=Verdana color=#800000 size=2>Deep in jungle I am went
On shooting Tiger I am bent
Bugger Tiger has eaten wife
No doubt I avenge poor darling's life
Too much quiet, snakes and leeches
But am not feared these sons of beeches
Hearing loud noise I am jump with start
But noise is coming from damn fool heart
Taking care not to be fright
I am clutching rifle with eye to sight
Should Tiger come I will fall him down
Then like hero return to native town
Then through trees I am espying one cave
I am telling self - "Ranga be brave";
I now proceed with too much care
From nonsense smell this Tiger's lair
My leg is shake, I start to pray
I think I shoot Tiger some other day
Turning round I am going to go
But Tiger giving bloody roar
He bounding from cave like shooting star
I commend my soul to Kali Ma
Through the jungle I am went
Like bullet with Tiger hot on scent
Mighty Tiger rave and rant
Rangaswamy shit in pant!
Must to therefore leave the jungle
Killing Tiger one big bungle!!
I am telling that never in life
I will risk again for damn fool wife </FONT></DIV><SPAN style="COLOR: white" width="1">__._,_.___</SPAN> <!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --><IMG height=1 src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97476590&amp;grpId=2556773&amp;grpspId=1600016061&amp;msgId=6584&amp;stime=1157469662" width=1>
