Sometimes, the people with whom one shares one's path
Are very congenial company....

When old scenes are brought back to the mind and heart.

at the Shaw Nature Reserve...but the good part is that if my fellow-travellers on the aircraft see me scratching away, I might have a nice row of three seats all to myself....!
