I found an interesting root being sold on vendor's cart.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/34348206443/in/dateposted-friend/" title="IMG_4586"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4278/34348206443_13201ddf71.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="IMG_4586"></a>

The scientific name, Manjula Desai tells me, is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maerua_oblongifolia"> Maerua oblongifolia </a>

This belongs to the Capparaceae (Caper) family.



It's called "bhoo chakra gadde" in Kannada, (it would be better translated as "bhoo shakkar gadde"...earth-sugar tuber". I am not able to find the name in Tamil.



Here's a video of a slice being smeared with lemon, dipped in sugar, and served:

Here's another video, where the skillfully-carved slice is served without lemon or sugar:

Someone says it is from Haridwar.

is a scientific study of the DnA of this root.
