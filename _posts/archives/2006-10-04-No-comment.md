Just because there is a Karnataka bandh, there are. apparently, no channels but Kannada ones on TV today. Just swtiched on the TV and watched, for a&nbsp;minute or so,&nbsp;some ladies competing by sorting out different coloured bangles and putting them on a stand. Much excitment amongst the ladies watching.
