Today I attended a Celebrtity Wedding with Many Page Three Personalities Making Their Appearance....but the image that stays in my mind at the end of the day is of this wonderful-looking creature, at the Bangalore Rehabilation Centre, an animal rescue and rehab centre that I visited this afternoon.


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9190033@N03/761484059/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1196/761484059_09c6dd5586_o.jpg" width="480" height="455" alt="Juv Brahminy Kite 090707" /></a>


The kite was apparently treated and released to the wild; but he (I think it is a he, could a she have, in <LJ user="asakiyume">'s words, this "fierce gaze"?) keeps coming back, and seems to be held in great affection, too! 

A whole crowd of parakeets had been rescued from somewhere and Salim and his team were trying desperately to make some sickbay cages ready for the sick ones among them. 

I don't know if they need money or not; but they do need volunteers of all sorts....
