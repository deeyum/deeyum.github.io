How many children do you think would like to attend playschool at "Trendy Play Home", where at any moment their parents might make this appointment for ear-piercing?

 And if one looks at the wording differently.... does " ear-piercing" actually  describe the screams of the children in the playschool? But in that case, it won't be "painless"...
