I am always amazed at the helpfulness of today's youngsters...I only hope we were as nice to OUR elders as this new generation is to us. <LJ user="sainath"> saw my post on learning and has just spent over an hour on the phone, walking me through the process of uploading pics to Flickr and posting pics on LJ.

Thank you so much, <LJ user ="sainath">

I hope you get the course of your choice, and I hope I get to boast, in a few years' time, about knowing you as a young man!

<LJ user="amoghavarsha"> taught me how to make userpics on LJ...I can't forget that, either...


For them, I suppose, it's all so simple!
