....

Well, I am back with KMC (K Mohan's Camera) in one piece, and now there's going to be a spate of photographs of Bandipur, all my OWN (somewhat awful) work!

A lot of people who are going to look at my snaps are good photographers. To them, I say: move on, move on. My name in photographese is not even Murphy, its...Sekhar, spelt, Shaker. It's as if the all the earthquakes <lj user="yathin"> experienced in California had come along to jog my elbow. So if you expect crispness, technical correctness...pass on, pass on!

The rest of you....here's my intro shot of Bandipur, with a hide-and-seek game...that's the tip of the elephantberg! Will post more pics and an account of the trip....later....! 


AM I WELL CAMOUFLAGED?
