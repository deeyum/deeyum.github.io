When it's winter, even waterfalls freeze:

When one has a dry, warm home with plenty of food, the snow is very enjoyable...especially when seen from inside a heated car!

A suddenly pointed out that the snowflakes had a lot of definition...so I rushed to try and get photographs of them. The challenge was to focus and shoot before they melted!

On my denim jeans:

On the car window:

And this is the best I could get without exposing the Biddles to a snow flurry:

Next winter, I hope to make snowmen for my little Biddly...

Must get some better snowflake images from the internet!
