I got what I thought was another Black-Crowned Night Heron, but no...it was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-crowned_Night_Heron"> YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT HERON </a>.

If that's a yellow crown the bird has, I'm the Queen of England, see you all in Windsor Castle...

I ask you...is this any way to pose for an eager birder who's come halfway around the world?
