<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/505440.html"> Chandu </a>

has become such a close friend over time....I can't even remember how I met him...was it when I went to meet the NTP members in October 2008? 

Anyway, he and I have done 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/740070.html"> several trips </a>

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/759866.html"> together </a>


He was supposed to be part of my  team for the Bird Race, like 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/625723.html"> last year </a>

...but he got into a bird race of his own..with the stork! Suvarchala, his wife, was suddenly advised to go in for a C-section this morning, at their home town, and poor Chandu rushed with his mother to Tirupati, and hired a cab....but the stork won the race, as his son arrived before Chandu did.

So...hearty congratulations to a dear friend on "puthra prApthi" (acquisition of a child)...hope to hear more details from him soon. As I write this, he's probably holding his son in his arms, and gazing down at him in the delight that only belongs to brand-new parents....
