Oh my goodness. What am I supposed to do if I don't know if what I have seen is a butterfly or a moth? Can both of these not be posted to insectindia? Thank goodness there is only one egroup for dragonflies and damselflies, as I have no clue what a damselfly is (except that I think that many damsels turn into dragons later.) I happen to know that there are other insects that mimic spiders...now where should I post emails about those?

Very soon I am sure there are going to be specific egroups for, say, left-handed toads, or red-coloured five-petalled wildflowers, or birds spotted only in South Bangalore...and of course cross-posting NOT allowed...

Thank goodness for sites like India Nature Watch which has all these categories in one, AND includes landscape also as part of Nature..

I am a "generalist" whether it's insects or birds or trees or mammals or reptiles, they all fascinate me....and sadly, the world is getting more compartmentalized...if I have a sinus ailment, I will have to go to a different doctor if it is the left nostril and a different one if it is the right..and yet a third one if BOTH nostrils are blocked...
