It was a wonderful experience to go to Gamla Linkoping (the old town of Linkoping), where heritage buildings have been brought in and re-built with every possible care. There are several museums, housed in these old buildings, that visitors can walk into. In the whole area, many people who are in period costumes walk about; and today, when the local newspaper was pushed into the mail slot, I found out a bit more about two musicians whom I met there.

Here's Jacek Malisz, with his accordion:

And here's Lasse Strom (er, that "o" should have an umlaut), with his "Strohfiol", which is a violin with an amplifier:

And here they are, playing together.

Jacek's accordion, he told me, was over a hundred years old. Lasse was very much more witty; he had a "spiel" of dialogue ready for the tourist that I was. He told me how the basic element of the violin had been integrated with this amplifier (it was made of aluminium) for the better carrying of the sound, in the days before microphones and loudspeakers (and, indeed, electricity) were in place.

"Do your children also play this?" I asked him. "No!" he said emphatically. "When a child learns an instrument, it's cruel for everyone else around to hear it!" "But your parents somehow put up with the noise of *your* learning," I laughed; and he laughed with me. "Regarding music...one of my daughters has a ear," he said, and I nodded sagely, understanding about having a ear for music. Then, of course, he added, "The other one has TWO ears!" and laughed happily at having cracked a good joke!It was my turn to laugh with him!

I am trying to get the link to the newspaper article about them (it appears in the "Summer" supplement to the June 25/26 issue of "Linkopings Posten"). <lj user="kejn">, if you could help me, I'd be very grateful, I've not been successful yet!

With the help of Google Translate, I've learnt that the two musicians have been playing at Gamla Linkoping for the past 32 years, but this is going to be stopped soon...sorry, I couldn't wade through the entire article, typing it out on Google Translate!
