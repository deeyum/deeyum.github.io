DnAnK are already in the air, and we are having to postpone going to Chennai to receive them....there's still a lot to do and organize here....I hope I get everything done so that we can leave at least tomorrow, and I can be reunited with KTB....wonder how she will handle the Chennai heat when in St.Louis, she perspires if the temperature crosses 25 deg C!

I am less than impressed by the way caterers here, as soon as they've started making a name for themselves, start coasting and resting on their laurels. I need to find a fresh caterer as the one that was our first choice keeps telling us how busy they are when we call, and asking us to call later! If they are too busy with present business, where's the future business going to come from?

OK, off to face the day...the weather's been so lovely.

Yesterday a friend came over as he's leaving Bangalore to take up a job in Goa. We spent two hours talking over a million topics....such friendships are what I've been really missing.
