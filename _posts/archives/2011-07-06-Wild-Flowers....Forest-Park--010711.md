The Coneflowers are blooming all over Forest Park, and for once, I thought I'd post just a single photo of their wild beauty:

It's  rather too hot and muggy to walk around after the morning, so I am not rambling in Forest Park as much as I'd like to....I'm going swimming at the YMCA this evening, and that's going to be much more comfortable.
