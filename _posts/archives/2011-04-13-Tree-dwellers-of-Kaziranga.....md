No, I'm not referring to the birds here! There were two creatures that my friends were very eager to see....the 

HOOLOCK GIBBON

 and the 

BLACK-CAPPED LANGUR

 (Well, they wanted a few more, but those....they didn't get!)


We were able to see the male Hoolock Gibbon first....

Almost immediately, we realized that there was a mother-and-child duo quite close by:

After a little while, the mother felt secure enough to let the baby away from her body, and let the little one swing around by itself:

The Langurs made their appearance in a herd, and it was tought to photograph them while they were leaping about from tree to tree. But I tried my best:

You can see her how fast some of the mothers were going!

Two of them finally sat down for a few seconds, at least!

We'd earlier also seen some


ASSAMESE MACAQUES:

Alas, we could not see the Stump-tailed Macaques....!
