It's always a pleasure to watch anyone skilled at work...and it was no different as we passed a wedding hall near my home and saw this palm thatch getting ready...

What deft interweaving of the palm frond ! And to think how cheap it is......

I love to see baskets and mats and such beatiful things being woven from bamboo, rushes and reeds. 

I hope we continue to employ these artisans, who weave magic with their fingers.
