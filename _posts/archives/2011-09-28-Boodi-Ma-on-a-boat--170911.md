Those of you who are not interested in photos of GD...pass on please, this post is nothing but.

GD, who began her life as Eli (mouse), became Biddles, and Boodles and Beedool and then Boodi Ma (old woman, in Bengali!) went with her parents to visit her paternal grandparents at Portland, Maine.

"Is this post about me?" she seems to ask here.

<lj-cut text="Yes, it is!">


DnA met <lj user="itsalouwelylife"> in Boston and they all took the bus to Portland, and while there, went on a short cruise to Casco Bay.


Here's GD, picking herself up off the floor of the boat:

Finally...they call her "Hurricane Hair", but in this photograph, the whole family seems to have the same windblown hairstyle!
