It's a great feeling when someone you know does good....

<LJ user="anirudhc">, I have always known, is a very good photographer; it made me very happy when a friend, Pratima, told me that he had won the Blossom Fest photography contest:

That's a beautiful photograph, on several levels. It brought tears to my eyes.

Here's a photo that he took on my camera when we were on a birding trip together:

Great going, Ani, and wish you the best for more successes, and great photography...whether or not you win other prizes, your talent is great!
