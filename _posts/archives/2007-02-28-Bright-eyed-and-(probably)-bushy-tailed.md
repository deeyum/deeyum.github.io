Sometimes one need not go for the rare and exotic...what's right before one's eyes can be very appealing too!

Here's the little squirrel (ours are very much smaller compared to their American cousins)....

I loved the setting of the little fellow amongst the angles and the lines.

The caption could either be, "Life rocks"...or "a life on the rocks"...but the squirrel looks, literally, bright-eyed (and bushy-tailed though the tail doesn't show here!), so I guess it would be the former.
