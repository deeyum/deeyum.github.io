A very enjoyable trip to Gir (even though often fraught wich too much eventfulness for my liking...being slapped on the head by an arrogant guard at the Somnath temple, and nearly missing our flight back to Bangalore  because of an incompetent cab driver....made sure I could just about find time to check my email, and not post anything to LJ...but a recent photo of mine is on the Conservation India photo gallery (I don't know if they accept all photos or not)..


<a href="http://www.conservationindia.org/gallery/grizzled-giant-squirrel-bheemeshwari-karnataka"> click here </a>

to see it.

Will be uploading photos of the Gir trip soon....those of you who like lions and other mammals...and some birds...stand by!
