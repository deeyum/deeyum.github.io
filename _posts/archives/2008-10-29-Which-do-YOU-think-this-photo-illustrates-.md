Here the photograph is:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2187.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2187.jpg" border="0" alt="time passes slowly in my home 291008"></a>


That's my kitchen clock, you can also see my kitchen timer, without which I would unfailingly carbonize everything I cook.

Do you think, after seeing the clock....


a. Time passes very slowly in my home, or at least, in my kitchen

b. Housekeeping is not my forte

c. Even my kitchen has an active website, how cool is that

d. How jobless can one be, to photograph kitchen cobwebs in the morning

e. Anything else that occurs to you... do post a comment!
