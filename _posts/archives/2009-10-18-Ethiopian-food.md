I found, when I went to Tanzania and Egypt, I realized that African food is quite similar to Indian food.

In St.Louis, one of my favourite places to eat at, has been the restaurant that serves

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_cuisine"> Ethiopian cuisine </a>

It's called

Here are the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera"> Injera or Injira </a>

on a plate that proudly announces the restaurateurs' love for their mother country!

It was only after I had a few bites that I suddenly thought of taking a picture of the platter, with many dishes on top of the injira (you can see the names of the various dishes on the Ethiopian cuisine link):

Service is a little slow, probably because we are generally the first customers of the evening whenever we go! But it's always service with a smile, and we have never failed to enjoy the food and the very nice, informal atmosphere of the restaurant.

We generally get enough leftovers to have a meal at home too...and since we are south Indians, the injira goes well with sambar and moLagAippodi! :)
