Not being savvy enough to have the net on my mobile, I am sitting in a seedy internet parlour in Guwahati, having gorged on momos for lunch....had a lovely day visiting Dakshineswar in Kolkata yesterday...will be out of touch for the next two weeks as I visit Dibru-Shaikowa and Namdapha...back on the 31st.

I do'nt have the time to visit my friend's pages, so I hope all of you are doing fine...

And here's wishing many of you a very Merry Christmas in advance, if I don't get to a computer again!
