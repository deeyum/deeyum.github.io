From <LJ user="code_martial">'s comment on <LJ user="latelyontime">'s review of Fanaa...

I find him to be a classic example of I-can't-make-sense-of-it-so-it-must-be-good syndrome.

How often does this happen to me...at contemporary art exhibitions, at post-modern music concerts, avant-garde plays.....I keep wondering if I am the only person around who can't make sense of it or if everyone is also pretending that the Emperor has fine clothes on!

Thanks, <LJ user="code_martial">!
