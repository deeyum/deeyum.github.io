Adarsh and Nisarg took me along to Madivala Lake this morning, and though we didn't have a great variety of birds, the SPOT-BILLED PELICANS, the ASHY PRINIAS, the TAILOR-BIRDS, a magnificient BRAHMINY KITE, CORMORANTS, CATTLE EGRETS, POND HERONS, PURPLE MOORHENS, GREY HERONS (apart from the usual crew of KMC...KITE/MYNAH/CROW) made for a very interesting time indeed.


Here's the scene that greeted us as we entered the gate:

You can see the pelicans serenely floating around...the water-hyacinth that has choked up the lake may actually be keeping the boaters from approaching the birds too closely....

This trip, for me, was a learning experience in terms of backlight. Here are the silhouettes of the two people who were with me this morning:

Everywhere, there were pelicans. Some made great silhouettes by themselves with the backlight...

Sometimes there were two going in different directions:

And here's a backlit view of a pelican landing:

On INW, where I posted this photograph, it was instantly dubbed the "Jesus Christ" pelican! ;-)

The morning light picked out a few tiny treasures, like this web just above the surface of the water:

Here's an adult Ashy Prinia in that light...

And here's a young one, looking so engagingly innocent:

Even the strands of grass looked like jewels in the light....

And as we went back out, I was  able to get this shot of the Brahminy Kite, which was sitting on an African Tulip (Spathodia) tree....

And the keen eye of the raptor...er...en"raptored" me!

A lovely morning...thank you, Adarsh and Nisarg!
