If one thought that violence against women was something very recent...here's a song which justificaties drunken violence against women: it says, "Ithu thAn iyarkkaiyin niyathi" (This is the law of Nature). Vannakkili was a 1959 film. The song makes me cringe

is the storyline, and pretty grim it is, too.

More information about the movie,

As long as people feel violence in any form is justified....we are not going to eliminate it.
