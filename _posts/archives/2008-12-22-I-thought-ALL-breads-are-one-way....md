I snapped this in Guwahati Central market....I never knew that some breads can be two-way, I thought all of them disappeared just one way!

Yes, I know it's a traffic sign sponsored by "Holsom" bread and biscuits, but how much better it sounds if read MY way!


The internet (either because of BSNL's problems or because of those cables being snapped in mid-ocean) has not been working since my return, and today I am catching up on mountains of mails, and the friends' list was done yesterday....

So wait for more postings from Kaziranga,Nameri, Guwahati and Shillong....! Don't go away, I promise you, some of them will be worth it!
