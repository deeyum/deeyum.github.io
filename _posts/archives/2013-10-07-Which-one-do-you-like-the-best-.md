I find that I take the shots, but am often not able to decide which is the good shot and which ones can be discarded.

Here are three photos I took of trees "crowned by the colours of Fall":

The second:

The third:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/10108001735/" title="1st Sat Audubon/FPF Bird Walk: 051013 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2888/10108001735_84287c1222_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="1st Sat Audubon/FPF Bird Walk: 051013"></a>

Obviously, the distance in each is different. Which would YOU prefer? Let me know.
