We went to Tilley  Park last weekend...and I feel that in the damp weather, the trees miss having dresses of green, so they deck themselves up with frills:

I looked at some lovely pink growths at the edge of the lake:

They were mushrooms,too, seeming to grow like lotuses in the pond:

(if you're thinking what I hope you are not thinking, you have a dirty mind. They DO look like lotuses and nothing else, I assure you.O)



I decided to take a snap of another pink mushroom that seemed to be growing out of a human being:

Some mushrooms are more precious than others...
