It's been a phenonmenal time here in Tanzania...first at the Ngorongoro Crater, and then in the Serengeti since yesterday. We started with a superb time birding in Kilimanjaro airport while we were waiting for KM's brothers to fly in...and then as we drove into the Ngorongoro Conservation area, we started with a night sighting of a leopard so close by...and except for the rhino, I think we have sighted all the animals,birds, reptiles and other stuff one could think of...and then some....

Two things which are fantastic...the total lack of plastic in the wilderness, and the immense discipline of the wildlife trips, which means that the animals are not afraid, and do not melt away immediately (though of course some do)...we have got some phenomenal shots and videos...the highlight being a pride of lions, including two cubs, walking down the road amongst the safari vehicles, another of two Thomson's gazelle fighting in dead earnest, four types of vultures feasting on a carcass, two lionesses circling around a kill which they cannot eat because a band of baboons are trying to chase them off, a couple of ostriches doing a mating dance...with a couple of cheetahs as audience, the incredible line of migrating wildebeest stretching kilometers across the Serengeti plain....some of these are very far away, though....and the really colourful, splendiferous birds...the crocodiles and the hippos, the baboons and the vervet monkeys, the hyenas and the different kinds of jackals....

We have had hardly any sleep, because the power went down at night almost every day, and we had to recharge the camera batteries, and download the photos and videos....when we could.

At Kirawira camp, where we are now, the internet connection costs 10 USD for 15 minutes, so my next post is only going to be when I reach Dar es Salaam after the trip....

All my friends, I can do a lovely presentation on the Ngorogoro Crater, the Serengeti, and Lake Manyara (which we are going to day after tomorrow)...when I return...

Oh, Tanzania....words are just NOT adequate, will have to say it with the pictures. How happy I am that I took up photography!
