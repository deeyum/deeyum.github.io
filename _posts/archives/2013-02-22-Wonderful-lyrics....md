The lyrics:

Kuch To Log Kahenge
Of course, people will talk
Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna
That's what they do...talk
Chhodo Bekaar Ki Baaton Mein
Forget it.. this useless topic
Kahin Beet Na Jaaye Raina
Might waste the entire night away
Kuch To Log Kahenge
Of course, people will talk
Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna
That's what they do..talk

Kuch Reet Jagat Ki Aisi Hai
The way of the world is such
Har Ek Subah Ki Shaam Hui
That every morning has an evening
Tu Kaun Hai Tera Naam Hai Kya
"Who are you? What's your name?" (they ask)
Seeta Bhi Yahan Badnaam Hui
Even Seeta (Rama's wife, known for her chastity and purity) was maligned here
Phir Kyon Sansaar Ki Baaton Se
Then...why do the words of the world
Bheeg Gaye Tere Naina
Make your eyes wet?\

Kuch To Log Kahenge
Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna

Humko Jo Taane Dete Hain
Those who blame us
Hum Khoyen Hai Inn Rang Raliyon Mein
Saying, we are lost in these pleasures
Humne Unko Bhi Chhup Chhup Ke
We've seen them, too, quietly
Aate Dekha Inn Galiyon Mein
Visiting these same places
Yeh Sach Hai Jhoothi Baat Nahin
This is true, it's not a falsehood
Tum Bolon Yeh Sach Hain Na
Tell me, is it not true?

Kuch To Log Kahenge
Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna

The hypocrisy of moral judgement is beautifully brought out in this song....
