Her FB update:

The Gods must have read my FB post about no pats on the back. Today there were two important ones. My boss introduced me & my role to the Board of Commissioners this morning. His was both gracious and grand in introducing my role and skills. After the meeting, the CEO asked what my previous role at Metro had been, and the COO explained on my behalf, and was also very complimentary - saying that I did an excellent and methodical job in managing 1/4 of the entire opening of the cross county rail line (a 9mile extension & ~$0.7 Billion job) in managing all the internal Metro preparation. Indeed, he elevated my past work to the level of the VP who was "managing the other 3/4".

How on earth did I give birth to this superwoman, I wonder!

Here's a pic of us from 1993:
