No profound thoughts are occuring in my cauliflower brain today (come to that, not in the past 57 years, some would say!)...so  here's a very beautiful bird that I photographed on the way to Kabini, on 140511...


We saw several of them, but two stopped in their swooping long enough for us to click:

And one posed with its catch, for a bit:

is the wiki entry about the bird....it's trilling noise is as much a delight as its beautiful feathers!
