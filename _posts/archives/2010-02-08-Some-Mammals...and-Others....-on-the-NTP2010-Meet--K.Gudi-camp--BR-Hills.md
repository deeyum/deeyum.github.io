Well, this post is NOT going to be about that mythical animal, the SIT (South Indian Tiger)....but as far as the other mammals went, the NTP meet had nothing to complain of....

Firstly, the 

<a href=""> WILD BOAR </a>

I don't know why they are called "wild" around the K.Gudi camp...there's an excellent symbiotic relationship between the two, and they are not afraid of humans at all!

The 

<a href=""> ELEPHANTS </a> are certainly not as common as they used to be, but are still easy enough to sight:


Here are two, mother and child, with the red mud on them:

Here are a few moving past:

The 

<a href=""> GAUR or Wild Bison </a>

are also beautiful, majestic animals, looking neatly shod with white socks!

Here's one giant, crossing the safari path:

the magnificient antler of this 

<a href=""> CHITAL </a>

stag had me photographing him in the rain:

We were also lucky to be able to sight a

<a href=""> FAN-THROATED LIZARD or Draco:

Right next to the parking lot was this spiral of the

<a href=""> SIGNATURE SPIDER </a>:

and the 

<a href=""> LANGUR </a>

were, as usual, athletic, and leaping from  tree to tree:

The rain on the first day was unrelenting....here's a video of the deer with the proud antlers, just to give an idea of how hard it was:

The 

<a href=""> MALABAR GIANT SQUIRRELS </a>

were also sighted several times:
