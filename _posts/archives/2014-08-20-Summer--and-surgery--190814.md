Even if school has begun, summer evenings are fun times.

<lj-cut text="about summer, and surgery">

Kobe is the little 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shih_Tzu"> Shih Tzu </a>

(no, that's not Shit Su, that name comes from the Chinese for Lion Dog!) that the neighbours, Sandy and Michael, have.

When the mother is very allergic to cats and dogs, the family can't have pets, but the next best thing is playing with the Dog-Next-Door! (That's Mike in the background.)

As Sandy trims the lawn, Kobe (named after Kobe Bryant), frolics with KTB.

Green grass and blue skies are made to run and jump around.

And then sit and communicate, without words:

Meanwhile, the brother goes into surgery for 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoidectomy"> adenoidectomy </a>

not with any apprehension, but a huge joy at all the gadgets surrounding him!

The toys in the children's ward are great, too!

Their smiles and play light up my heart!
