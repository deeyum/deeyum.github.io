Mostly, I am not able to see the "post to journal" button and cannot post. I cannot comment on my friends' entries and sometimes, I am not even sure I am seeing them all.  I am getting Japanese spam as well, nowadays. I am on the verge of quitting LJ...it's only that I hate something getting the better of me...today I am able to post!
