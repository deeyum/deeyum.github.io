I had made

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/646507.html"> this post </a>

about the Housefinches which nested in both Arbor Vitae trees in 2010.

For the past few days, I have watched the buds slowly emerging on the bare Japanese Maple tree, and was wondering if the House Finches would return...and wow, just now...

I quickly put down the baby and rushed to get this beauty...

Now I'm waiting to see what happens in the next few weeks! Last time, a severe storm destroyed the nests (and, alas, four hatchlings in one of them). I am hoping for the best this time...
