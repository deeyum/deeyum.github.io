I found this delightful view of this delightful, colourful little bird amongst the photographs...I don't know if I took the picture or KM did; but looking at the detail of that little spider-web thread just next to the bird, and its clarity, I feel it might have been KM rather than me...

Sadly, we didn't get any pictures of another colourful bird on the Ganesh Gudi campus of JLR, the Malabar Trogon....
