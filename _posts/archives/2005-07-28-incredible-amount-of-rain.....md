seeing the visuals on TV is amazing enough...but to be there must be really something else....I am impressed by the average Mumbaikar's ability to stand firm in the face of the forces of nature. 

...Am wondering what sort of effect on the economy the ONGC disaster will have...we are already suffering from our dependency on petroproducts, and even before this happened, there was talk of hiking petroproduct prices yet again...

I very rarely write about contemporary news, but an all-time record rainfall is something to take note of...
