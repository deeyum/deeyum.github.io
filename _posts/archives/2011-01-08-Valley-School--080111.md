It started out as three people...Naveen, Nandan and I, going to Valley School; but the minute I realized that more people could go...I ensured that more people DID! So finally, it was 8 of us who had piping hot coffees at Park View, before going off to a misty morning at Valley School.....here IS the misty morning:

Of course, the minute you enter Valley School, one or more dogs appoint themselves your guides, and stick with you throughout your outing!

Here are the other seven, engrossed in bird-watching and id-ing:

<lj-cut text="some more images">

We started with the lovely sight of several

SILVERBILLS
 
in the morning light:

and a couple of them were foraging on the road:

An

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN

came and went:

Several

COPPERSMITH BARBETS

which Valley School is famous for, made their appearance:

We watched this 

JUNGLE MYNAH

with the blue eyes, trying to make its nest in a dead palm tree:

<lj-embed id="609"/>


A 

SHIKRA

kept giving us great sights...on the tree and in the air..in fact, one was flying above us just 4 km from my home, over Reliance Mart junction!

I loved the scene with the 

WHITE-BROWED BULBUL:

Overhead, we saw one of the usual

ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARDS:

This 

CALOTES

was hidden between the leaves, but we spotted it as it was spotting us!

Vittal wanted me to document this

DEBRIS ORB SPIDER

for further id:

and there were many

WOLF (or FUNNEL-WEB) SPIDERS

about, sitting at the entrance to their parlours:

Of the several butterflies that we saw, I got the

ROUNDED PIERROT:

I  finally found these two un id 

MOTHS

in the School toilet, before we finally went towards a very welcome breakfast:
