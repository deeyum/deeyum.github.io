I was walking to see the Stingray exhibit in the St Louis Zoo, and on the way, I spotted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killdeer"> KILLDEER </a> (what a funny name, that wiki says that's what their call sounds like!):

It was accompanied by another one, and they kept running fast, and then "couching" down on the wet grass like this:

The wiki says they lay their eggs in the grass, so I thought, when I saw the first one sitting that way, that it was on its eggs....but no, it wasn't; they kept running and sitting alternatively. Wonder what this behaviour was.

Update: Here's the short video that I took:

Then I saw this one, which both <lj user="yathin"> and Dave Pierce of the <a href="http://www.stlouisaudubon.org/Birding.htm"> St.Louis Audubon Society </a> id'd as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kingbird"> EASTERN KINGBIRD </a> :

I do mean to walk a lot more in the park area and see what other birds I can sight, but it's going to depend on the weather (very rainy lately), the sun (don't want to walk in the hot sun, either!) and Eli's demands...today she kept me all afternoon, glued to her side!


And since I have talked about her, here she is, with some very easy-to-follow instructions on her little dress:

And she's saying, "give me five minutes more to sleep, because I am.....

to wake up immediately!"
