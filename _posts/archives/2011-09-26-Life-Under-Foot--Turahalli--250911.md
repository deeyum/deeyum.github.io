Even the shortest step on a nature trail can yield something fascinating to the observer. I was walking down the path at Turahalli, when I looked down:

Three little ants, working together, and working very hard, to convey a dead insect to the underground nest, where it will become food:

Ant you glad you "e-came" with me to Turahalli, and saw this tiny drama being enacted?
