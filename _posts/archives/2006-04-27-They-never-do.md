Will ANY of the Deccan Herald's links work properly? Just tried the link on <LJ user="jace">'s LJ to see the write up about him...doesn't work.

I know that since I started posting on LJ all my stuff can be read (without being hacked down or decimated for want of newspaper space) on it, but still, it's nice to send my relatives some of my stuff in print...and it is frustrating when I click on a link and it takes me  1) to someone else's article; 2) to a page about a month or so away from the date I am looking for; or 3) nowhere.

I am in a constant state of email conversation with this newspaper about this!
