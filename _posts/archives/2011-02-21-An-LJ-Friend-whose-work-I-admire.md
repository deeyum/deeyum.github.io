When I have something to write about, it so happens that something else, that I hit on by chance, suddenly clamours for a post!

Let me describe today's chain of events. I got an email from 

<a href="http://ovshake.blogspot.com/"> Abhishek </a>

with a link to his latest blog post Having read it, I decided I must add him to my Google Reader...which, thanks to not having a laptop, I had not visited for some time now. So when I went to Google Reader, I happened upon the blog of 

<LJ user="dearchichi">

..whose photographs on LJ moved me to friend him, and over a period of time, I got to know fairly well...including a birding session in Lalbagh with him, looking at the Mottled Wood Owls.

He and I are much less in frequent contact these days, as he has become a quasi-professional wedding photographer, in addition to his day job. But going through his latest blog posts, I was really struck by the quality of his photography. 

He has always been a talented photographer; his portraits of his family, posted on LJ, have always moved me. But now, I feel that he has got such a distinctive style of his own, that I will be able to make out his wedding photographs amongst the work of many others.

It's wonderful to see someone with talent, using and honing that talent so well. 

<LJ user="dearchichi">....I don't know about the rest of your family...but I am really proud of you!
