<lj user="idahoswede"> has been looking at sarees on the Internet, and sent me a few links, and I loved thi description:

"Miraculous Saree.Endow you with beautiful sensual feminine personality. Red saree body, pleat, pallu and border are accentuated with designs so exclusivly enriched with resham, zari and sequins embroidery that is outstanding, magnanimous."

Would a magnanimous saree let you take it home for free?


I thought not....all that flowery language, I notice, has only added to the saree price!
