Stephen kissed me in the spring,
David in the fall.
Robin only looked at me...
He kissed me not at all.

Stephen's kiss was lost in jest,
David's lost in play.
But the kiss in Robin's eyes
Haunts me night and day.

Other parts of lyrics that I love:

"iru vizhiyaaley maalai ittaaL" (she garlanded me with her eyes).

"Mohabbat ko chupaanaa  hee mohabbat hai" (hiding love IS love.)

poetry...beauty...aesthetics....what an amazing thing the human mind is.
