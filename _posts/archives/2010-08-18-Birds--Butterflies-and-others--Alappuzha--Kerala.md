When I went to Alappuzha, I certainly didn't imagine that I would be seeing birds or butterflies...but the lovely Kayaloram resort gave me just such an opportunity!

Someone had actually decided to make a "Butterfly Corner" on the campus, and put up photos of the butterflies that could be seen there. However, the receptionist (Mary) told me, "This was done some time ago...it's all dried up now, Madam, you can't see any butterflies." 

Thankfully, her information was completely inaccurate....with the possible exception of a few of the butterflies listed, (Eg. the COMMANDER and the PEACOCK PANSY) I saw EVERY butterfly, even the beautiful

SOUTHERN BIRDWING

which is the largest butterfly in India! Here's a quick shot I got of it, fluttering past:

Here are the helpful butterfly posters:

and this:

How helpful it is to have someone take such an initiative!

I found these two

SKIPPERS

proceeding in an orderly line on a leaf:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0267.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0267.jpg" border="0" alt="skippers on leaf 120810"></a>

and one on a leaf alone:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0216.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0216.jpg" border="0" alt="skipper 150810"></a>


the

SOUTHERN RUSTIC

was a new butterfly for me, and I was thankful for the help in the id:



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0262.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0262.jpg" border="0" alt="southern rustic 120810"></a>

the 

MALABAR RAVEN 

was listed as the "Malabar Ravan" and I was wondering if, indeed, Rama's archenemy had come to be named among the butterflies, before I realized that it was the Raven!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0264.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0264.jpg" border="0" alt="malabar raven 120810"></a>

The

COMMON MORMON

(not the Moron!) sat around, I should call it the Mormo as its tail seems to be missing!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0258.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0258.jpg" border="0" alt="common mormon 120810"></a>

The 

GREY PANSY 


was relatively easy to photograph as its flight is not quick:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0253.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0253.jpg" border="0" alt="grey pansy 120810"></a>

another Pansy that was around was the

CHOCOLATE PANSY:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0517.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0517.jpg" border="0" alt="chocolate pansy 120810"></a>

the

BLUE TIGER

was also easy to catch, while it sat on the flowers:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0479.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0479.jpg" border="0" alt="blue tiger 150810"></a>

So, too, the

COMMON CROW:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0477.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0477.jpg" border="0" alt="common crow 150810"></a>

The 

COMMON EMIGRANT

also co-operated:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0225.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0225.jpg" border="0" alt="common emigrant 150810"></a>

But there were two butterflies which were VERY difficult to catch. One was the

BLUEBOTTLE:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0209.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0209.jpg" border="0" alt="bluebottle 120810"></a>

and the other was the

TAILED JAY....

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0222.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0222.jpg" border="0" alt="tailed jay 150810"></a>


 I didn't get even a half-way satisfactory shot of it!....these two kept flitting about in the most infuriating manner, and while I was concentrating on them, the Southern Birdwing suddenly flew past...oh, I was one frustrated photographer for a while, until I decided I wouldn't bother too much!



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0174.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0174.jpg" border="0" alt="common mormon120810"></a>

<a href="http://birdsonthebrainetc.wordpress.com/"> Uma </a> tells me this dragonfly is the

   COMMON PICTURE WING (male) - (Rhyothemis variegata):


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0266.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0266.jpg" border="0" alt="un id dragonfly 120810"></a>

I am waiting for her to help out with this one, too...she did, and this one is the female! :)

I also got these flies on the flowers:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0536.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0536.jpg" border="0" alt="flies on flower 150810"></a>

The common birds were all around me, and it was a delight to watch this

WHITE-CHEEKED BARBET

enjoying the mango fruit!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0147.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0147.jpg" border="0" alt="barbet eating mango 120810"></a>

Of course, the 

GREATER COUCAL

skulked around just out of sight, but I got this quick shot of the bird on a cottage roof before it skulked off again:

DARTERS

are not that common near Bangalore, so it was nice to see a lot more of them on the backwaters, sitting on the floating pieces of wood and Water Hyacinth:



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0413.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0413.jpg" border="0" alt="darter 120810"></a>

In the resort, this 

RUFOUS TREEPIE

jumped around in the arecanut palm trees, and was easy to capture:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0169.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0169.jpg" border="0" alt="rufous treepie 120810"></a>

Along the waterways, there were far less Common Kites than in Bangalore, and several beautiful

BRAHMINY KITES

...this one sat next to our resort, and often fished in the waters (never very successfully, as far as I could see!)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0493.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0493.jpg" border="0" alt="brahminy kite 150810"></a>

LITTLE CORMORANTS

are, next to Crows, the most common bird in the area, and here's one preening itself after being in the water:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0490.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0490.jpg" border="0" alt="cormorant preening 150810"></a>

This 

STORK-BILLED KINGFISHER kept flying in and out, and in the pouring rain, this is the only shot I could get:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0859.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0859.jpg" border="0" alt="stork-billed kingfisher 150810"></a>


and high up in the trees of the resort, this

BLACK-HOODED ORIOLE 

appeared  in a flash of yellow:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0128.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0128.jpg" border="0" alt="black hooded oriole 120810"></a>


Another tree at dusk yielded the sight of this large

FRUIT BAT:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0450.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0450.jpg" border="0" alt="fruit bat 120810"></a>

The flora, too, was varied and beautiful. These MOSS SPORES on the Lily leaves looked so pretty:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0855.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0855.jpg" border="0" alt="spore on lily leaf 150810"></a>

High up on the tree where the Oriole was, this

BRACKET FUNGUS 

bloomed:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0485.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0485.jpg" border="0" alt="bracket fungus 150810"></a>

The resort had several plants of 

BIXA ORELLANA

which I had seen earlier in Agumbe:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0850.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0850.jpg" border="0" alt="Bixa orellana 150810"></a>

I was told that this plant was called "Oddalam" (it looked a bit like Frangipani):

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_0487.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_0487.jpg" border="0" alt="oddaLam plant and flowers 150810"></a>


..and that the fruit was extremely poisonous...!

Right in front of our room, this 

HAMMERHEAD SLUG

slowly made its way to the soil:

</lj-cut>

Of course, this

WATERLILY

which always seems to glow from within, makes a lovely closing shot, of the various living things that I was privileged to see in Alappuzha!
