Here are two snaps that I like; they are both of birds on buildings, but it's the photographs that I like...

Some of the detailing on the buildings and houses that I pass on my morning walk are so beautiful. An artistic touch speaks of the pride of the workman in the job being done...

Amazingly,someone actually had a sculpture of me enjoying my morning walk!

And having  enjoyed all the sights and sounds, I go back Om...

I do enjoy the lack of dust, the good roads, the right of way that the pedestrian always has, the pathways that are there on all roads....oh, there's a lot of things about my morning walk that I will miss when I go back to India!
