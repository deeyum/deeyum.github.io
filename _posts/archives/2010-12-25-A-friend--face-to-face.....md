<lj user="prashanthchengi">  had started commenting on my blog a while ago, and we've got along like the proverbial house on fire, so I was thrilled when he said he was going to be in Bangalore for a couple of days. Yesterday evening, he came over, and we talked and talked and talked and talked some more.

I took him for a baitu at Park View, we walked around the Mini Forest, and then he came over home and we...talked some more!

He's an interesting and versatile person, and we disagree as much as we agree. We went to the Crosswords Bookstore (he loves to browse!) and luckily, it turned out that he had not yet read "Life of Pi".

Here's the young man in question:

There was none of the awkwardness I expected at meeting someone for the first time...he was exactly as I expected, and I wonder whether that holds true for him, too :)

Bangalore is his home, but he's been living in Pune for a few years now. Nice to have an LJ friend come face to face!
