Though we wasted two and a half hours first waiting for the suitcase and then lodging a complaint about its going missing, thank goodness, it has been located at last, and will, hopefully, be delivered home some time today....I realized that though it contains many things, I am now in a position to say that I could have got along without any of the stuff...good, perhaps I am making some progress on the path of non-attachment....

I also realize, each time I visit the States, how few possessions I really require to live...why, then, do I surround myself with so much of stuff, and why am I unable to give it away? 

On other news, let me get organized (gas leak in the kitchen onwards) and I will get around to posting some pictures....esp the bald eagle ones....
