I met 

<a href="http://larenloveless.com/"> Laren Loveless </a>

a very dynamic musician and percussionist, at the Bonfire event organized by the St.Louis Beacon. I decided to send him a video featuring Indian percussion instruments.

Featured are  some of the percussion instruments of classical south Indian, and one of classical  north Indian music.

The north and south Indian systems of classical music are quite different, but share a lot of features, too. 

All our instruments are tuned to a particular pitch before being played, except, perhaps, the morsing.

Western drums (we are especially fond of the bongos!) are extensively used in our movie and light music. One of our very talented contemporary music drummers is
