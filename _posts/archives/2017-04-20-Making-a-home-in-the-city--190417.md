As I stepped out of my daughter's home, early in the morning, the liquid, burbling call of the Red-whiskred Bulbuls had me looking around. I spotted them flying around and landing near the front entrance:

I soon realized that two of them were busy trying to build a nest in the ornamental palms flanking the entrance.

Look at the beauty of this bird, very common in our city:

Are they also pondering about building apartments, one above the other?

In Shivamogga, too, two of these birds had made a nest in my hosts' home:

The lady of the house (er, nest) was well-ensconced in the cup-like nest, with only her beak showing:

I left the birds to their breakfast, and walked on.
