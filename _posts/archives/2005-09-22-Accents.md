I thought I had watched enough Hollywood movies to be able to follow American English as she is spoken...but alas, therre is just now way some of the citizens of St Louis, and I, can understand each other! I find it quite impossible to understand what some of them say to me...and the reverse is also true. I went to a nearby supermarket and asked where I could find the milk...and there were four friendly, wanting-to-be-helpful-but-completely-foxed people looking at me blankly.  I finally mimed milking a cow and got my response! Thank goodness, this problem occurs in the South and not in the NorthEast of the US...I suspect that a Texas drawl is going to be beyond this too!
