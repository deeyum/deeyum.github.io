<lj-cut text="the birds that I did manage to photograph">

Of course,since I was in a light-hearted mood, I *had* to see this Cardinal-upon-a-light!

I got home to id this bird as an 

EASTERN BLUEBIRD;

I got a closer shot of it later:

I *think* this is the female:

I knew this one was a 

TUFTED TITMOUSE

from my visit to the World Bird Sanctuary:

I got this one id'd as the

BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE:

I was lucky enough to see a 

NORTHERN FLICKER

not on the tree, but on the ground, foraging!

It was lovely to see the crescent on the chest!

On the bird walk, Chris mentioned that a mosquito-based disease had decimated the populations of American Crows and Blue Jays, which was why they are much rarer than they used to be. I found one foraging amongst the leaves:

I could not get the id of this little bird

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2473.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_2473.jpg" border="0" alt="un id warbler singing 070310"></a>

But recorded its loud, confident song!

Could this one be a Goldfinch female? Not sure...


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2476.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_2476.jpg" border="0" alt="goldfinch female? 070310"></a>

Here's another view of the bird:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2480.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_2480.jpg" border="0" alt="un id bird qp 070310"></a>

Neither could I id this little beauty: (update, Pen Grady-Pawl agrees with my id of Yellow-rumped Warbler.)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2479.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_2479.jpg" border="0" alt="un id warbler qp 070310"></a>

And finally, as I clicked these two birds upon a tree... (Update, Pen Grady-Pawl says they are probably Brown-headed Cowbirds.)

I looked at my watch..and WHAM, where had 35 minutes gone?? Umesh had finished his run, so off *I* ran, too, to go home with him...

Here's how the Park looks at this season; not a blade of green grass, not a green leaf in sight...

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_2495.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_2495.jpg" border="0" alt="corporate trail queeny park 070310"></a>

But in all that grassland live so many birds!



If anyone can help me with these bird ids.....please do
