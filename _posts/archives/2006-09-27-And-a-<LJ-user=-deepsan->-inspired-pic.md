Those of you who are used to shopping in gigantic malls...hold your breath. What I have pictured below is a shop; it is exactly as wide and as high as the doorway. I went during the afternoon siesta time, so I got this pic, which&nbsp; belongs to the category I call the&nbsp; DeepsanGeometry!

A shop in Jayanagar 9th Block market area. See the three horizontal markings on the top part of the door? Those indicate that the shopkeeper (in this case, I think it's a tailor) is a follower of Shiva. And there are two "god" pictures on the doors too...Ganesha on your left and Lakshmi on the right.
