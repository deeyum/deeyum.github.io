title:  The left-handedest compliment I have received

I got an email from Deccan Herald, saying that as I was sending articles to different departments, different people were selecting it..and the result was that my articles were being featured too often in the newspaper for a freelancer. So I should, the email said, space my articles henceforth, and submit one 15 days after one got published! I don't know whether to feel complimented, amused or annoyed...red tape is everywhere....

After several years of writer's block, I feel like putting down my thoughts all the time now...if not for LJ, I would have died of frustration, I think! I write for myself, but like others to read my stuff too....
