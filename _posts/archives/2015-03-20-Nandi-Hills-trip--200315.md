When Kiran Kashyap suddenly called and asked if I would like to join
in for a trip to Nandi Hills, I must admit, I was very ambivalent. I'd
just had cataract surgery in  both eyes a week ago, and was still in
the process of putting in various eye-drops (sorry, in today's world,
i-drops!) every couple of hours...should I go or not? In the event, I
decided that if I couldn't see much, I could at least enjoy the beauty
of Nandi Hills...so off I went with Kiran, Guru, and Manju.

<lj-cut text="More..if you like...">

And wow....I was so glad I did! Beginning the Indian Blue Robin at the
"leaking pipe" site near Tipu's summer lodge (I hope they never repair
it!) , and going on to the spectrum of Thrushes and Robins in the
nursery area, it was just a rain of birds. The Asian Paradise
Flycatchers, too, were there in white and rufous glory, ribboning
their tails to and fro. I got one changing from rufous to white!

Babblers, both Puff-throated and Tawny-bellied, walked in and around
the flowerpots, tantalizing us. The Nilgiri Wood Pigeons

 and the Pied Thrushes,

which we normally look for near the Akashganga, all appeared
as if on cue, for us.  It was only the knowledge that the masala dosa
counter at the top of the hill closes by 9.30 that made us tear
ourselves away.

The Auricaria cookii tree near Nehru Nilaya yielded the Red-breasted
Flycatcher, and Olive-backed Pipits in the lawns nearby. We sighted
many Ashy Drongos, but only a single Black Drongo.(No, don't ask me if
it was married!)

Apart from the birds, the trees were wonderful, too. The beautiful figs of Ficus drupacea,

the different greens of the leaves;

 the Jacaranda and the Tabebuia aurea flowers carpeting the ground with purple and
gold...

even the fresh copper-sheen leaves on the mango

 and the peepal trees were such a visual treat.

 The nursery area was soothing to the eye,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16252102223" title="IMG_5281 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8746/16252102223_a5baf8ed10_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5281"></a>

 with the golden morning sunlight falling on so many flowers. We
saw the loving care that the staff lavish on the gardens in the Nehru
Nilaya.

It was lovely to have the place practically to ourselves,
for a change; the weekday, and the fact that we are in the middle of
the 'exam season', contributed to the general peace and quiet. I would
not like to visit Nandi Hills a couple of weekends from now, I must
admit!

I must repeat my query...have there been any sightings of Owls or
Owlets from Nandi Hills? I've never seen one...yet.

I am sorry...I couldn't clearly see the butterflies, but I did see a
few flitting around; I've included the very basic list.
