The only undomesticated animal in Lalbagh, I think, is the perky, bright, busy <a href="http://www.indiasite.com/wildlife/mammals/three-stripedpalmsquirrel.html"> squirrel </a>.

I loved the morning light on this gymnast:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96476944@N00/418839312/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/418839312_1c9511bb0d.jpg" width="479" height="354" alt="Squirrel on the rocks" /></a>

They are everywhere, and they are almost-but-not-quite-tame....bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, they really add interest to any visit to Lalbagh or any other park, for that matter!

I will soon be posting the story of a heroic (well, heroinic) attempt by a squirrel to get some nesting material up the tree...
