This beautiful, ornate bird, with a long tail that feathers out in black, white,and grey-blue, was caught in the rain and waslooking quite huddled and miserable! There were four or five of them dancing on the conifers outside our cottage at Munsiyari in the mornings and the evenings...quite an entertainment!
