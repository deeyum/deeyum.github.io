It's taken me an hour and a half each time, with several tries, to get three entries up today...

I am not able to comment on anyone's posts...so dear friends...please know that I am (at least) able to read some of your posts...it's very hard for me to "keep quiet", but that's what LJ is forcing me to do! Hope things get back to normal soon....I am off to Kabini and Coorg for 3 days, too, so this looks like a very lean week on LJ!
