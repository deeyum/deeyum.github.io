Drove to Delhi from Chambal, and by the time we'd dropped off some of the members of our group and meandered through the BJP Rally, we were dog-tired, and didn't even think of any shopping or visiting. Am at a friend's home, and we're taking the early morning train to Haridwar.

Meanwhile, I've been able to get my hands on KM's laptop and Reliance card, so I've posted some pics to Facebook:

to see some of them.

Alas, it is SO much easier to post photos to Facebook than to load them to Photobucket, title them, and then post to LJ.... :(
