<LJ user="anushsh"> helped Karthik put up a page on the common flowering trees of Bangalore on his website, here at

I think it was very nice of Anush to do this, and help a very knowledgeable person share some of that knowledge with others. (I will not, of course, mention here that <LJ user="kalyan"> has also helped Karthik put up the website; as it is, he is saying that I have added "too much masala" to my account of him in my JLRNTP article!)

I am touched when I see youngsters who make such good-hearted gestures. Way to go, <LJ user="anushsh">!
