<lj user="aneeta_04"> tagged me  with this meme/award. I have a little time while The Biddles is asleep, so let me do it quickly!



1. Thank the person that gave this to you.

Dear <lj user="aneeta_04">....

Thank you for tagging me for this award.  I,too, consider this more of a meme thing, I, too, am glad you chose me and enjoy reading my blog. 

2. Copy the award and put it on your blog.

3. List 3 things you love about yourself

This is a great exercise! Let me see...
a) I have a good sense of humour, and this has carried me through so many crises in life.

b) I never let go of friendships if I can help it.

c) I try to get the bad stuff in my life in perspective, and realize that life has been very kind to me indeed. I could be negative and say my husband had a heart attack at the age of 38...but I prefer to think that it was a great early warning that we needed to change our lifestyles, and that it's made us healthy eaters, and include exercise in our lives.

4. Post a picture you love


Now this...I literally have THOUSANDS of pictures that I love...how to choose? So....let me post a photo of the sky I took yesterday....

The "fingers of God" always symbolize fresh hope and optimism to me. I'm grateful that I am a happy person, with much to be happy about...
