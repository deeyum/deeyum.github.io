It's not given to everyone to watch the Sea Lion show sitting on their 91-year-old great grandmother's lap!

You admire the whiskers:

You also take a little time to explore the railings:

You wonder when the show will start:

You watch the seal sliding down the chute:

You wonder at its ability to balance that ball so perfectly:

You watch Mark, who's volunteered, as he interacts with the pinniped:

You love the smile on his face:

You wonder if you would like fish as much as these creatures do...

You are stunned to silence when the Sea Lion arrives:

You watch a little more:

You go down to the water's edge with your Amma and Nana, to get up close and personal with these creatures of the sea:

You go out to enjoy the rest of the Zoo, talking excitedly about the Sea Lion show!
