She looks at me, through the chair.
Intent, serious, candid stare.
What,I wonder, does this little one think?
What makes her look without a blink?
Does she really look at me,
Or is she living in her world of fantasy?
Just this moment our eyes meet...then we part ways...
If we meet in future days,
I'll not know her when I see
Her...and neither will she know me.
But for this magical moment, our eyes meet.
As I look into the face of innocence...sweet.
