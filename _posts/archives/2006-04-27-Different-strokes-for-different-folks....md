I realize that people post on LJ for widely varying reasons. <LJ user="udhay"> says he got on to LJ to post comments on other people's blogs; <LJ user="themadman"> says it is not his primary writing, but he uses it for stuff that won't fit in elsewhere. Several people use it to post pictures.

For me, LJ is a kind of pickling jar. The daily dose of writing is good discipline for me, as I try to write fast, yet get the right words. And after I have posted, if I go back to the post and still like what I have written, off it goes to the newspapers, hopefully, to be accepted...or, if not, to survive still in the LJ electronic memory, somewhere in e-space...
