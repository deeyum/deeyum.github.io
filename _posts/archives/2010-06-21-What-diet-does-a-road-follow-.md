Though we have so many traffic accidents, Anna Salai is committed to vegetarianism:

Why don't we ever have anything that's not "pure" vegeterian? What IS "pure" vegetarian, especially when most of the places that put up these boards definitely consume milk and milk products, which make them non-vegan, at the very least?

I like to say, since I try out all sorts of food without a hang-up about it, but have never liked any non-vegetarian food enough to convert to non-vegetariasm..... that I am an "impure" vegetarian.
