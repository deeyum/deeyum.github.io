The

in B R Hills, is a lovely temple. 

Here's the vENugOpAla swAmy ("God who plays the flute and tends the cattle") shrine, and the dhwaja sthambhA (stylized temple flagpole):

All along the course of the Kaveri are temples to Vishnu as "Ranganatha" , or "Ranga" or "Ranganna" or "Rangaswamy". I wonder why this deity is always associated with this river.... there is Srirangapatna, there is Srirangam in Tamil Nadu, there is Ranganathittu, there is the Biligir Rangana temple, there is the Rangaswamy Betta....all are on various places on the Kaveri river.

Others may sing the praises of the Ganga and the Jamuna, and the other mighty rivers of the north;  but I have lost my heart to the beauty of the Kaveri....the beautiful maiden of southern India.
