I don't often go near the nest, and this even means not stepping out on the porch as the Housefinches fly in and out....but yesterday I did peek carefully and...

I wonder if those eggs are fertilized or the first "trial" batch that females sometimes lay...well, I guess I'll know soon.

Sorry for the bad image, but I have to take the shot from the only angle at which I can see into the nest (not open to the sky or predators, thank goodness.) I can't see into the other nest at all, as one frond seems to have grown out. I hope that has its "nest egg" too!
