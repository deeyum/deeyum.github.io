It was dusk. I was walking back from the Farmers' Market; I had a gallon of milk and several vegetables to carry, so it wasn't a great time for photography... at Delmar Station, I heard a high "cheeking" noise, and looked up to see the KESTREL, hovering in the air, making the noise.

With one hand, I aimed the MLC and took a shot....

I really wish I could have aimed steadily enough to take a video of the hunting behaviour of the beautiful raptor!
