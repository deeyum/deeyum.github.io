Termite nests, extend to quite a depth below the ground as well as quite a height above it...and the temperature remains regulated throughout, in all seasons. Here, one can see the wall perforations for temperature control:

I was very tired within a short span of time, and Madhu kindly dropped me back to the bus stop. I came home and fell into a deep sleep, but I enjoyed my morning very much!
