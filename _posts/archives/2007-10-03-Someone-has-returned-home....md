I am going to meet an LJ-er face-to-face...

<LJ user="shivakumar_l"> has always been very, very helpful with his photography tips, and today I realized that he is back in Bangalore for good; so looking forward to meeting him. He is, of course, going to be appalled afresh at my camera-ignorance, but I have no pride in such matters! He is also a Canon guy...and is one of those people who don't mind drilling stuff into concrete heads... 

We will probably go birding in a day or two...
