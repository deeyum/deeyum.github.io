I do love the walks I take; Forest Park is a beautiful place, but I like walking around the neighbourhoods, too. This evening, to walk off the excessively heavy masala dosa and upma that we all had at the St Louis temple, I went for a long evening walk too....

I'll start with the birds...

The HOUSE SPARROW is not well-regarded here; a board on the golf course seems quite unfriendly to me, in a country where the Statue of Liberty says all refugees are welcome....

But the sparrows seem to thrive, nevertheless; this male seems to have an "open and shut" kind of dwelling!

<lj-cut text="More stuff from a couple of walks">


This evening, I spotted this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Heron"> GREAT BLUE HERON </a> in one of the small lakes:

Since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Martin"> PURPLE MARTINS </a> keep swooping and hawking in the air, it was difficult to get one sitting down, but I finally managed one photograph:

Though they usually look quite dark, here one can see how they got their name!


Everywhere, the bushes are full of these small jasmine-like flowers which have a faint, nice scent, too:

Some of the trees have these beautiful seed pods and flowers:

I spotted a lot of these MUSHROOMS in the grass, but will need <lj user="asakiyume"> to tell me if they are edible..I wouldn't take a risk!

Their undersides looked so beautiful....

I loved the different colour of this tree as the bark had been stripped away:

Looking at all of that, I mumbled to myself, "God Bless America!" and immediately saw this licence plate:
