Went to see the 

<a href="http://www.saintlouisartfair.com/park.htm"> Art Fair at Clayton </a>

and then went along with 

<a href="http://forestparkowls.blogspot.com/"> Mark Glenshaw </a>

to see the Great Horned Owls in Forest Park...will download the photos and videos and share it with my birding friends soooon....

Thought particularly of <LJ user="anushsh"> and Sharad Sridhar, with whom I went to see the Horned Owls of Turahalli, and spotted them just when Sharad had locked his keys into his car!
