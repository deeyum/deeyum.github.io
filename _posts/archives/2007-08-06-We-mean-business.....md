Before I start on the birds post and bore everyone to death (I must confess, I have still downloaded only the first-day-of-the-trip's photos!) here's a very nice mission statement from this shop in Kilimanjaro Airport...once you have bought from them, they want to have nothing more to do with you!

Oh, well, by and by, they might become more shopper-friendly....;-))
