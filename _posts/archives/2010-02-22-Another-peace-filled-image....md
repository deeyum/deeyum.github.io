I love this photograph for the feeling of calmness it gives me...

Yes, the Thattekkad bird photographs are getting uploaded and I'll do the post shortly..which reminds me, there were several flights from the same destination due at the airport, how did Snow White know which one the Seven Dwarves would be arriving on?

That's easy, the announcement said that the Delhi flight was expected shortly....
