On DnA's TV, there is "closed captioning", so I often have the volume off even when I am watching

The only thing is, for the past few days, the caption comes about a minute AFTER the words have been spoken on screen...and this leads to several hilarious situations, one of which just happened.

There was, I think, an ad for diapers, with a baby trying to totter a few steps... and the tagline read, "It's a wobbly world". Meanwhile, the ad disappeared, and some thing else appeared, which depicted Irag and Baghdad...and the caption, quite apt, stayed on the screen!
