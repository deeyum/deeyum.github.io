Kannan had wanted me to take him to Valley School, but earlier, there were too many people coming, so we went to Ragihalli instead. But this Friday, though it kept raining pretty heavily, Chandu, Kannan, Jayashree and I set off..... the rain actually made several things more beautiful...look for example at these lovely berries, dripping diamonds!

Would you like to see some of the things that I managed to photograph? 

<lj-cut text="more images, and about the outing">

All the plants were bejewelled, even the very common 

LANTANA 

bushes:

I loved the name of this tree...this is the flower of the 

UMBRELLA or the OCTOPUS 

Tree. The flower glitters with raindrops, too!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0195.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0195.jpg" border="0" alt="umbrla tree 220411 vs"></a>


Quite appositely, this the flower of the 

RAIN TREE, also called the POWDER PUFF TREE:

The

MAYFLOWER TREES (GUL MOHAR) 

had already responded to the heat by flowering in April:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3648.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3648.jpg" border="0" alt="vs myflwr 220411"></a>

I photographed this succulent flower, which also has sweet nectar at its base:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3653.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3653.jpg" border="0" alt="un if sclnt vs 220411"></a>

PASSION FLOWERS  (PASSIFLORA) 

were all over the place:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3650.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3650.jpg" border="0" alt="passiflora 220411 vs"></a>


The

SILK-COTTON

pods are ready to burst, propelling the silk-cotton and the seeds for wind dispersal:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0196.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0196.jpg" border="0" alt="slk cton pds 220411 vs"></a>


On the road were several 

COTTON

plants, with the cotton bursting out of the seeds:

Under one tree sat a beautiful idol of

GANESHA:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0176.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0176.jpg" border="0" alt="ganesh 220411 vs"></a>


under another sat a set of musicians...making wood music, perhaps?


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0178.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0178.jpg" border="0" alt="musician dolls vs 220411"></a>

You can see how weak the sunlight was, even at 8am, though the rain finally stopped!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0183.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0183.jpg" border="0" alt="weak sn 220411 vs"></a>


The drizzle didn't stop us from getting out of the car here and there to look at birds, and we often forgot to shut the doors!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3595.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3595.jpg" border="0" alt="kannan&#39;s car 220411 vs"></a>


Here are Jai, Kannan and Chandu, intent on seeing a White-cheeked Barbet that was actually eating a dragonfly:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0179.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0179.jpg" border="0" alt="chandu kannan jai 220411 vs"></a>

The tiny birds were the first to come out after the rain slowed to a drizzle; here's a

PURPLE-RUMPED SUNBIRD

sipping nectar from the flowers and buds of the

COPPER-POD 

tree:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3623.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3623.jpg" border="0" alt="pr snbd vs 220411"></a>

One another tree, a 

PURPLE SUNBIRD

was doing the same thing.

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3618.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3618.jpg" border="0" alt="prp snbd 220411 vs"></a>


Across the pond, we watched a

PIED KINGFISHER

sitting patiently on the foliage...until the moment came, and in a black-and-white splash into the water, it got itself some "fast food"!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3615.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3615.jpg" border="0" alt="pd kf 220411 vs"></a>

Earlier, we'd seen this as-yet un-id'd

CUCKOO 

at some distance from us.



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3596.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3596.jpg" border="0" alt="un id ccko 220411 vs"></a>

Though it looked somewhat like a Common Hawk Cuckoo and somewhat like a Grey-bellied Cuckoo, the totall rufous head has puzzled us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3604.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3604.jpg" border="0" alt="un id ckoo 220411 vs"></a>


That was the back view of the bird after it flew to a Lantana bush.


A 

LITTLE EGRET

got ready to pierce its reflection:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3628-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3628-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>



a

CATTLE EGRET

poked about in the weeds:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3629.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3629.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

We saw a

SHORT-TOED SNAKE EAGLE

soaring high above us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3651.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3651.jpg" border="0" alt="stoed sn egl 220411 vs"></a>

We heard the plaintive notes and looked at a female

KOEL:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3659.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3659.jpg" border="0" alt="fml kl vs 220411"></a>

Heard the lilting song of the

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3660.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3660.jpg" border="0" alt="omr 220411 vs"></a>

saw a

COMMON MOORHEN 

walking about:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3643.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3643.jpg" border="0" alt="cmn  mrhn 220411"></a>


Other creatures were fascinating, too. Here's a common-or-garden

SNAIL

crossing the wet road....probably started a few days ago!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0161.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0161.jpg" border="0" alt="ord snl 220411 vs"></a>

Here's the

AFRICAN SNAIL

which came into our country along with agricultural imports and is now officially a pest, over-running all local species:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0181.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0181.jpg" border="0" alt="african snail 220411 vs"></a>


As we were on the road home, we could not resist stopping to spot, and snap, this

PENINSUAR ROCK AGAMA:

 
<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3713.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3713.jpg" border="0" alt="agama vs 2204111"></a>

We saw two 

CRABS

in the pond:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3641.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3641.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Chandu spotted this very beautiful

CARPENTER BEE:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3671.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3671.jpg" border="0" alt="crpntr bee 220411 vs"></a>

It was tough to take this

COMMON CROW 

against the sky:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3712.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3712.jpg" border="0" alt="common crow 220411 vs"></a>

but a 

TAWNY COASTER 

posed for us!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3709.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3709.jpg" border="0" alt="tawny coaster vs 220411"></a>

I loved the colours of the

BLUE TIGER

against the Lantana:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3678.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3678.jpg" border="0" alt="blue tiger 220411"></a>

A very tiny

COMMON CERULEAN

alighted on a leaf, like gossamer:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3654.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3654.jpg" border="0" alt="crln vs 220411"></a>

I got my first-ever sighting of a seasonal butterfly, the 

SPOT SWORDTAIL:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3697.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3697.jpg" border="0" alt="spt swdtal side 220411 vs"></a>


</lj-cut>

A wonderful morning...none of us knew where the time went, and we finally had "breakfast" at 11.15 am!...Here's a lovely "sitting portrait" of the Spot Swordtail:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3703.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3703.jpg" border="0" alt="spot swdtl vs 220411"></a>

And let me close with my regular boyfriend, the

TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER

which Kannan wanted to see, and finally did!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3613.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3613.jpg" border="0" alt="tbfctchr 220411 vs"></a>
