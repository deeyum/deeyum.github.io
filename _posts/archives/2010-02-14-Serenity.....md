Photographed this peaceful scene in Thattekkad....


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_1329.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_1329.jpg" border="0" alt="thattekkad scenery 090110"></a>


The absence of human beings in the photograph somehow adds to it calmness...but the human presence is there, at least behind the lens!
