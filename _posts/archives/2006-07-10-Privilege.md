....



Had a HOT bath before leaving...and it occurred to me how privileged we are, to have drinking-quality water coming out of our taps 24 hours a day. We may crib about infrastructure and having difficulties, but certainly, some of us have a most privileged life...

A hot bath on a cool morning, and a cold bath on a hot one...one of the pleasures of life!
