We saw a variety of creatures on our trek near Chik Yelchetti, and into the forest area; I'm giving the bird-list at the end, but here are some of the living things that I C-on-C (Caught on Camera):

This is the 

WHITE-BELLIED DRONGO:

<lj-cut text="lots more creatures">

After a long gap of time, I saw an

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN

singing away:

It was lovely to see a crowd of

POMPADOUR GREEN PIGEONS 

atop this bare tree:

Another view of a few:

Overhead, the

IBIS

group flew past in an aerodynamic Vee formation:

And closer to the ground, the chirpy

HOUSE SPARROW

group announced that they were thriving here, at least!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3300.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3300.jpg" border="0" alt="sparrows on the wire 220910"></a>

I never got a good shot of the

COUCAL,

it skulked too successfully in the bushes for me...but I got its feather!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3012.jpg" border="0" alt="coucal feather 210910"></a>


The mammal list was:


Boar, Wild (and a rowdy lot they were, too!)
Deer, Spotted
Elephant, Indian (er, difficult to spot the African elephant here!)
Gaur (a herd came right up to the stream near the home-stay, and our driver had to move the car hurriedly.)
Macaques, Bonnet

Ravi, our guide, spotted the elephants when we were really far off from them; they were across the lake, on Thondala betta:

The next morning, too, we sighted a few:

Here's a video to show the far-offness of the first lot of elephants!

The

CHITAL

are beautiful, no matter how common they are at Bandipur!

But our nature trail yielded a lot of Life Under Foot, and apart from the 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/715025.html"> SIX-SPOT GROUND BEETLE </a>

and the 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/714896.html"> DUNG BEETLE </a>

we saw....this

CRIMSON MARSH GLIDER (Trithemis aurora)( thanks for the id, Uma!)

these 

ANTS

 foregathering on the tip of this shoot, for some reason (tasting the sap?)


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3324.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3324.jpg" border="0" alt="ants on twig 220910"></a>


The monochrome beauty of the

CHOCOLATE PANSY:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3329.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3329.jpg" border="0" alt="chocolate pansy 220910"></a>

and this un id

FROG:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3261.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3261.jpg" border="0" alt="un id frog"></a>

I wondered what this was, and Ravi told me that it was the top of a termite mound, which the boars break open to eat up the termites inside:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3227.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3227.jpg" border="0" alt="bear-eaten termite mound"></a>

In the home-stay, on the blue-painted pillar, a

JUMPING SPIDER

was busy catching breakfast:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3021.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3021.jpg" border="0" alt="spider with prey 210910"></a>

and elsewhere, this dead insect was being taken home by industrious ants, to feed their colony:

A lot of the flora was very interesting, too. Here is the

MATTHI 

tree, used for furniture:

I was enchanted by the dessicated beauty of this

CACTUS

 framework...

I wonder if this field-border plant is

SISAL

...it looked so beautiful against the sky!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3320.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3320.jpg" border="0" alt="hedge plant"></a>

Its flowers were lovely, too.

One of the shrines in Lokkere village stood under the shade of a gigantic

FICUS:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3319.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3319.jpg" border="0" alt="ficus 220910"></a>

I could not id these lovely seedpods, which were like inflated balloons:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3263.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_3263.jpg" border="0" alt="balloon-like seedpods"></a>

Ravi showed us a thorny plant with edible berries:

Here's a closeup of them, before they went into my mouth! (They were seed-crunchy and tasty!)

Since the 

PIED WAGTAIL

With all this to see, the scenic beauty of the villages, and the eco-activities, Chik Yelchetti is a great place to stay in!
