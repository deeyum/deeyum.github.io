<LJ user="shortindiangirl"> finished the Lewis and Clark half-marathon at St Louis.

Read about it on her blog:

The wonderful part is the incident that she writes about.... ittouched
me so deeply.

It's good that a young woman  runs and finishes the
run, too, but a lady who has just had a mastectomy doing it? I am dumbfounded!

What amazing people we have around us!
