Yesterday her fever seemed better, so we had a new maid:

...who has to have the broom colour-coordinated to her clothes.

<lj-cut text="more about our evening">



She was teaching her GF to put pink dolls on his glasses:



and her grand-aunt how to do puja:

We took her in her stroller to Luz in the evening...to the Luz piLLayAr kOvil:

and we watched the devotee throwing a coconut "shitharu kAi" with all his might:

there were garlands made of different types of flowers, to be offered to VinAyakA:

We looked up to see the seeds in the silk-cotton tree:

We went into  a shop to buy some clothes for her, and saw baby jetties for sale (note for non-Indians, "chaddi" is what we call underpants)

could we fill ourselves up with nitrogen air?

We watched another baby in a thooLi (KTB had her own, in St.Louis)

and had meaningful conversations with that baby's sibling:

On the many walls of the city, one finds beautiful art work; it was lovely to see both painted and real bullock-carts together!

The evening had an enlightened grandfather and grand-daughter laughing at each other!
