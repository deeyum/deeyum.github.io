Pretty, lively, and young;
A head full of dreams
A prattling tongue;
Once Upon A Time.

A little more mellowed
Having met Real Life
Some dreams having yellowed:
Once Upon A Time.

Love, family, daughter;
Duties to do.
Music turning to water
Once Upon A Time.

Shattered, and broke.
World dried up and withered.
Tried a smile, and a joke:
Once Upon A Time.

Now, a steadier course;
Happiness again.
Put away, with force...
"Once Upon A Time."
