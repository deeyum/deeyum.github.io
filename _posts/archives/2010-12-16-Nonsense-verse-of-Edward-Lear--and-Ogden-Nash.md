These are two people whom I hold in high regard, for their mastery of the language...


I have a pash
For the words of Nash
And I hold the works of Lear
Very dear....
I wish I could play with  words
With a talent like Edward's....
I'd write wonderful verse, then,
Comparable to Ogden.....
I'd make English
Bend to my will,
Serve up my verse as a delectable dish;
And cook up further rhymes, still.

Thank you,

whose links to Lear's nonsense verse got me on to this track today.
