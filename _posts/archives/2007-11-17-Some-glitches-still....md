The new comp still has a few glitches, not ironed out yet...I can't post to Metroblogs (have done so from my ancient dino!)...can't play a few Yahoo games, esp bookworm which is one of my favourites...

Getting a new laptop to work takes a LOT of effort...! Also, the "skin" that I got to prevent that super-white keyboard from rapidly becoming a grey keyboard is useful, but makes it necessary to use much more pressure on the keys....

What's the big deal with this white fascination, in computers as well as human skins in India? The dust and dirt of the Indian climate makes it such a difficult option...
