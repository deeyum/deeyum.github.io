During refreshments before the event, I captured this angel:

for more information about the Children's Eternal Rainforest.

The fact that second-graders from children could feel this compassion and act upon it, and make enough of  an impact that children from 43 other nations also joined in the effort, is quite staggering to me.

who was named by Time Magazine as a Hero for the Planet, spoke:

I have long wanted to meet Dr. Lovejoy, a scientist who has done pre-eminent work in the rainforests of the Amazon.

Another eminent speaker, who orchestrated the fund-raising by pledge envelopes, and spoke with passion about his farm in the Eternal Rainforest, was
