<LJ user="mriga">, <LJ user="madrasi_in_mo">,<LJ user="akhilsamrat">, <LJ user="amoghavarsha"> and me...Neer dosas and other stuff at Park View...such a lovely time, and we allowed KM, the only non-LJ-er, to participate too!

Akhil is SO delightful...and he took to Amogh very quickly and actually said bye to his parents when Amogh was holding him! Apparently, Akhil would have been called Amogh, too, if not for the parents' fear that the name might be badly mispronounced in America....

Will wait for <LJ user="mriga"> or Amogh to post some pics.
