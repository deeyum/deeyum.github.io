Gulakmale was also cloudy and misty on Saturday morning, with the sun making an ineffective effort to pierce the clouds:

The insect world, however, became quite active, and this 

LEAF-CUTTER BEE (Thank you, Karthik, for the id)

showed her blue-striped  body and gauzy wings:

There were many

COMMON THREE-RINGS

on the grass:

A

GROUND SKIMMER

zipped about, letting me getting a brief shot while resting:

This

SLUG

looks quite beautiful:

This un id insect sat on the leaf, hoping to have breakfast, and hoping to avoid being breakfast...!

After seeing so many Millipedes, it was nice to see some

CENTIPEDES

for a change!

These beautiful, tiny wildflowers added to the beauty at my feet:

On the drying pond, the 

WATERLILIES

bloomed in beauty:

The most amazing sighting was Shreeram's spotting this lovely 

ORNAMENTAL TREE TRUNK SPIDER ((Herennia ornatissima )(thanks to an anonymous reader!)

which Karthik says, belongs to the genus Herennia:

Isn't insect life and plant life as fascinating as sighting a tiger?
