....

We were sitting in the flat we have bought in Ulsoor, while my Pandavas...Electrician, Carpenter, Plumber, Painter, Mason...were doing various jobs...and watched the really beautiful view that we have from the front balcony on the eighth floor. It is, truly, a "typical Bangalore" view....Vidhan Soudha, Brigade Towers, Visweswarayya Tower, General Post Office, Chinnaswamy Stadium, T V Tower, St Germaine's Church.....and we watched an awesome sunset and the lights begin to twinkle....it was a time of peace and serenity. 

Will post pics of the "Ganapathi Homam" we are doing tomorrow; soon we will let out the flat, as moving to this location would easily add an hour to KM's daily commute to Hosur....but I do wish we could live in such a central location...hopefully, in a few years' time....
