If non-vegetarians advocating free-range chicken farming (where chickens are not "cooped" up but are allowed to run free) are SO concerned about those chickens' lives, why, then, ultimately kill them and eat them? Isn't it a bit like the witch feeding up Hansel?

"I want you to be happy until I kill you..."

We had a very lively debate over this, I realize it's one of those things that might never be resolved...
