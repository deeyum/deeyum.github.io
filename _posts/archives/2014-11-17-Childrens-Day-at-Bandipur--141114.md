As wildlife volunteers, Kumuda, Siddharth and I went to Bandipur to help celebrate Children's Day with about 150 children from three local schools: Hangala, Mangala, Bheemannabeedu.

I love that old Karnataka logo!

<lj-cut text="several images and thoughts from the day's trip">

Here are the Forest Dept. officials at the event:

13 of the children spoke about wildlife and conservation, and we were very impressed. One of the Adivasi teachers also spoke with great passion.

Here's Chandrakala, a versatile girl who both sang and spoke well:

Here are some of the children, who ran up and asked to be photographed...such delights!

Wildlife:

Love can be Wild-ly Boaring....

Hanuman Langurs were everywhere:

This beautiful 

ASIAN BROWN FLYCATCHER

delighted me:

As did this

TREE PIPIT:

The Peacock's breeding plumage, and That Amazing Tail, is just starting to grow out at this season.

"Horn OK Please" is the slogan at the back of most trucks (meaning, sound your horn to overtake)...but here was a horn, sorry, antler...

This plastic sheet, excreted (probably by a Chital) was a scary reminder that the litter we leave behind could kill animals that ingest it. This animal was lucky to be able to eliminate it.

Bandipur has always been a place of Mother and Child, for me. Here are the species that I clicked this time, quite appropriately, on Children's Day!

Just look at those two little cuties!


Human beings: 

Life at the edges of the forest continues to be hard:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15621759030" title="IMG_5301 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7515/15621759030_fb2e19aebb_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5301"></a>

Our old temples fall into ruins:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15621388447" title="IMG_5080 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7461/15621388447_d43d3b8bb3_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5080"></a>

But instead of maintaining them, we keep on building new ones...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15621728810" title="IMG_5076 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7496/15621728810_b1f3c36d01_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5076"></a>

Such beautiful banyan trees, shading the highway. They were planted long ago...can we keep up the practice?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15621177058" title="IMG_5078 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7490/15621177058_0f2838bf80_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5078"></a>

Contemporary Indian architecture certainly seems to celebrate colour!

So do our buses!

(Don't miss the usual hanging-from-the-footboard mode of travel.)

We also dropped in to see Loki (Lokesh) at JLR Bandipur, and I asked permission for Kumuda and Siddharth to see the beautiful murals in some of the rooms:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15621769640" title="IMG_5356 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5616/15621769640_f2313aee5b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5356"></a>

I'd written an article on the three artists who did the murals...the project was left unfinished, and the newer cottages don't have them.

I've put up more photos on my FB album,
