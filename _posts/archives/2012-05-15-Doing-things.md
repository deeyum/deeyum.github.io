I do enjoy the wit wherever I find it, and on the Hasiru Usiru egroup, a civic citizens&#39; forum that I belong to, S. Nityananda has posted, regarding car-free walking zones in Ahmedabad, which has been recently introduced:<br /><br /><div>&quot;at least something gets done in some cities. In Bangalore, we also<strong> do</strong> things... like deciding the dates for a preliminary meeting to discuss whether it would be advisable to consider deciding a date for discussing initial ideas for car free zones.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ll probably be thinking about this at odd timed, and there will be an unexplained smile on my face!</div>
