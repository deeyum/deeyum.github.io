The Chloropsis..the first time I heard this word
I thought, "A bird word that sounds absurd!"
But the name's because its body is a lovely, leafy green.
Because of this, the Chloropsis is not easily seen.

In the middle of all the leaves, can you see the bird?
And if you can, don't you agree, that "camouflage" is the word?
