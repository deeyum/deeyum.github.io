The day before I left for Yosemite, I decided to go for an evening walk, and hoped to see a Red-Tailed Hawk. I was unlucky with that, but as if to make up, on my way home I looked up...

Yathin and Dave Pierce, not to mention AMS, id'd it as the AMERICAN KESTREL. I've seen a lot of Turkey Vultures, too, but never a Kestrel before, so it was good that I was able to get a shot, even if it was a lousy one. If you look carefully, you'll see that it's got a small bird in its talons...

OK, working today on uploading the Yosemite pics, it's such a majestic place that even I have got good shots...will probably put up the post on Monday.
