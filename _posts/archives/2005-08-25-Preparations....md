Going away for 7 weeks is tough. The amount of stuff I want to take is staggering. Some of it (the main part) is stuff for others, but things like medication are what I don't want to run short of. Also, I am unsure what sort of weather to pack for, and so have to include warm clothes that take up both volume and weight. I do remember from the last trip that the majority of my Indian clothes were unworn, so this time I am going to cut down on that....But still one tends to overpack as one does not want to do without.

Sigghhhh....moral of the story, don't travel to too many places. Huh. Place moral in dustbin...and carry on with packing!
