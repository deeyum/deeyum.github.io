We were all (7 of us, inclduing a baby that was a little over a year old) in the van, heading out to Mephis, when one person asked, "What do all of us have that KM doesn't have?" We thought hard of things that a year and a half old baby might also have...and answers ranged from "common sense" to "hair"...what evil folks we are! And the answer was, of course....all of us had Live Journal accounts! (yes, my daughter opened an LJ id for the baby when he was born, the little bright-eyed charmer!)

Will post an account of the trip a little later...well, tomorrow,maybe...
