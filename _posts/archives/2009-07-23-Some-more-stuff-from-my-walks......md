As I walk in Forest Park, so many images fall on my mind's eye, and only a few of them are on camera. This post is mostly for myself, to look at later and recreate those magical evenings when the light melted into the purple dusk, the air held a hush, and I felt totally at peace....


I see very few butterflies, but I managed to get this tiny BLUE...

<lj-cut text="some random images">


The latlong of St Louis, in the centre of Forest Park (this one's for Enoch, who's always been hot on latlong)

Another RED-HEADED WOODPECKER which briefly sat on that tree-trunk, just long enough for me to snap him...

A lovely wooden bridge over Des Peres creek, with summer flowers in profusion:

The claw of one of the river crabs that's been eaten:

A dried-up flower, that still looks beautiful:

A mother duck and her brood, looking alertly at me before swimming off:

And this one is my favourite for the memory it brings back....the thundercloud was looming up, all the sky was a luminous mauve and purple, and the evening just glowed... the boat-lights shone dimly upon the waters of the creek, and the cool breeze was building up into a wind...dusk was a beautiful time to be there!
