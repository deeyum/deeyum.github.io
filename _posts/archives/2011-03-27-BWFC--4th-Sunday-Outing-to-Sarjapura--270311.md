One may go to see the birds, but everything is interesting and awe-inspiring, so I like to call these "Nature trails", rather than birding outings.

Here are the leaves of the Honge (Pongamia glabra) tree, backlit by the morning sunlight:

and later,  the leaves against the dappled cloud formation in the blue sky:
