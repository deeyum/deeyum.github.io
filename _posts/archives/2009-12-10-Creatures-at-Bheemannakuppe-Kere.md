Yes, I am getting to the birds, but yesterday's tooth extraction was particulary bad. My wisdom tooth had an extra root, which apparently curved deep into the jawbone...it took 45 minutes to extract it, and yesterday evening was one of the most ghastly I have spent so far....

But today I am feeling better, and let me first share the insects and other Life-Under-Foot photographs...


The trip to Bheemannakuppe was a learning process about

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagworm_moth"> BAGWORM MOTHS </a> 


I had made 

this post 

which included a photo of the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_bagworm"> EVERGREEN BAGWORM </a>

That had been infesting a tree in my daughter's garden, 

but in Bheemannakuppe, 

<a href="http://sangeethakadur.blogspot.com/"> Sangeetha Kadur </a>

showed us a couple of more varieties....

Look athe beauty of the wildflower on which the case rests!

Abhisheka Gopal, who works for

<a href="http://www.atree.org/"> ATREE </a>

showed me three stages of the Tortoise Shell , which is a variety of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle"> BEETLE </a>


Here's the beetle:

Look carefully, and you will see that the four black marks which look like legs are actually part of a rounded "ledge" all around the beetle!


Its larva stage:

Its pupa stage:

Abhisheka was sorry that she could not show us some eggs which would have completed the photography of the life cycle of the beetle!


Sangeetha also showed me this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitana_ponticeriana"> FAN-THROATED LIZARD </a>
<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9552.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9552.jpg" border="0" alt="fan-throated lizard 051209"></a>

We saw this  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fejervarya_limnocharis">CRICKET FROG </a> 

sitting, showing beautiful copper eyes:

Nearby, I saw this un id  CATERPILLAR making its way over the rock:

I could not id this BUTTERFLY:

This one was a BARONET:

The same plant that had the cylindrical bagworm case had this SPIDER mimicking a Stick Insect:

The dragonflies were single:

And sometimes double:

Well, we did see lots more, but that's all the Life-Under-Foot that I caught on camera! :)
