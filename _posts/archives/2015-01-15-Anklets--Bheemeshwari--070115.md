She wades out of the water, her beautifully-wrought anklets jingling, and her toe-rings spiralling round.

The beauty of the jewellery, on feet that walk over miles each day, captivated me, and I asked her if I could photograph those anklets. She smilingly obliged, and stood on the wet rock, on the banks of the Kaveri.

In fact, to me, this image is one of mother Kaveri herself, sparkling with silver as she flows on through the land...
