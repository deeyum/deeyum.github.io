I walked down to Forest Park, looking at the cotton candy that I could not eat...

<lj-cut text="some more stuff">


The first few scenes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor"> the Merry Wives of Windsor </a> were very well-produced:

And I tried to watch for while:

But the place was full, I couldn't get any water (I was very thirsty after that long walk), and the No-see-ums started biting,too...so I just turned tail and walked back home!

I liked this window in the Trinity Presbyterian Church, where I had walked another day:

And I wish I knew the name of the tree which bears these lovely flowers right now:

Spent the day in the home of some close friends, will share my thoughts about the Indian diaspora later...
