We watched the male and female Masai ostriches shivering their plumes in their ritual mating dance. They were pretty far away...but then, from the grass, two most unexpected heads popped up. Two cheetahs, taking their ease, languidly watched the ras-leela entertainment provided for them!

Once again, apologies for the graininess...its a camera video, the subjrcts were really far ooff (Nearly a mile away) and this was the first time I was shooting something like this...but it was riveting and I wanted to share it with everyone, too!
