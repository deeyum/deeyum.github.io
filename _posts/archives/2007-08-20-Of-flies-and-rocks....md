Yesterday, a group of us, including <LJ user="adarshraju">, <LJ user="amoghavarsha"> and <LJ user="anushsh">, went to visit the Bannerghatta forest area, where one of our fellow NTP members, Geetanjali Dhar, had invited us (the forest abuts her residential layout).

One of the images I got was of these flies mating:

and shortly afterwards, I saw these rocks:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11363665@N07/1161963516/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/1161963516_b4bd077504_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="rocks...they look exactly like the mating flies...will they give birth to pebbles?" /></a>


And I wondered if, in the course of time, the rock below would give birth to several little pebbles....

That's humour on the fly, but humour rocks!

And that reminds me, not of the fly, but the flea:


A wonderful creature is the flea;
YOU can't tell a he from a she...
But HE can, and SHE can...
Whoopeeee!


Well, actually, there IS one with a fly in it, too:

A fly met a flea in a flue.
Said the fly, "Let us flee!"
Said the flea, "Let us fly!"
So they flew through a flaw in the flue.
