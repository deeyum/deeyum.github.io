A close friend was very rude to me a couple of days ago...without reacting openly, I just disconnected. For the past couple of days, though I was feeling pretty bad, I just let things ride. Yesterday she called me up and explained how she had vented her anger at someone else on me. 

I seem to  have stumbled on the right thing to do. How to ensure that I keep from reacting immediately in situations like this? I like the fact that I have emerged from the situation with dignity, and with the friendship intact...and I want to treat every such situation in the same way.
