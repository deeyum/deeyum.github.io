Am off to Kalkere State Forest for the 3rd Sunday nature trail in a few hours,but meanwhile, was thinking of the many happy hours I've spent in Forest Park, St.Louis....

I do miss that wonderful park, with its wilderness, its museums, its lovely Zoo, and the many events it sees...and the devoted volunteers of Forest Park Forever, who have made a thing of beauty out of what was a stinky, stagnant river....I wish Chennai would base the recovery of the Adayar and the Cooum on the model of Des Peres River.
