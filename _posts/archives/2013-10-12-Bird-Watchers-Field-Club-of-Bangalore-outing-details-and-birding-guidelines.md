The Bird Watchers' Field Club outings are as follows,  each month:

The first Sunday outing is at Hebbal Lake, meeting near the entrance to the Lake, 7.30am approx.

The second Sunday outing is at Lalbagh, meeting at the Glass House facing the Bandstand, , 7.30am approx.

The third Sunday outing  is to a location in the Bannerghatta forest area, meeting at 6.30 am, details of venue and route will be sent by email to this mailing list in advance. There's an early meeting time for this outing,  as it is in the forest and often prior permissions have been taken. Please do not be late for this as you cannot go into the forest areas alone.

The fourth Sunday outing is to the Sarjapura area or to Kaikondrahalli lake, meeting at 6.30 am, details of venue and route will be sent by email to this mailing list in advance.

Outings typically last for about three hours.  Several of us get together for breakfast afterwards, sometimes.



Some general guidelines:

Clothing:

Dull-coloured clothes, comfortable walking shoes. Warm clothing during winter, hats/caps against the sunlight. Umbrellas/Raincoats during the rainy season.

To take:

Binoculars, Bird Book/s, Camera (optional), Pad and pencil to note down bird names and perhaps sketch them..

Food:

Plenty of water, snacks/food if liked (and if you like to share).


Please don't worry if you are a beginner. Get to the venue,and you'll see a group of people with binocs and cameras...just go up and introduce yourself.  By the end of the outing, you'd have found some like-minded people!

Avoid disturbance:

Don't unduly disturb the birds.
Do try to keep with the group, (especially in the Bannerghatta outing) and do not stray off by yourself.  Do not startle the birds with too much of noise. At each outing there will be experienced birders, do follow them to learn more.

Transportation:

If you have a vehicle:

Send an email to the egroup, mentioning  from where you are coming to the outing, your route, how many seats are available in your vehicle, and your mobile no. so that others who want to take a ride with you can contact you.

If you need a ride:

Send an email to the egroup, mentioning your location, your mobile no,  any landmark where you can be picked up, and how many people want the ride.

Hebbal, Lalbagh, and some of the venues in the Bannerghatta outing, are accessible by public transportation.

Outings typically last for about three hours.  Several of us get together for breakfast afterwards, sometimes.


Since these outings are purely voluntary, we ourselves do not know who will be there, hence we cannot always give contact  mobile nos.

Cheers, and have a great time on the nature trail!
