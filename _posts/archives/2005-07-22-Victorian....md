A friend would not allow her daughter to slip the ring on her fiance's finger at the engagement as "holding hands should only be done during the wedding"...the wedding is a few months in the future, and the two are going out together..and the daughter has been told not to hold hands. I offended the mother by suggesting they not hold hands even while kissing...the best part is that the young man put the ring on his fiancee's finger, and the mother of the girl is denying what is on video record, saying that it was the priest who put the ring on...well, in that case, her daughter is engaged to the priest! ;-)

We are firmly in the 19th century....
