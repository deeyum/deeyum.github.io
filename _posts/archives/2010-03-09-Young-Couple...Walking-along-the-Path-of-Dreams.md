They walk together, the young couple..
With their baby...their love.
They've taken a little time in their busy lives
For togetherness, to be with nature.
They walk along, towards their future;
Filled with dreams, and hopes...and perhaps some anxieties.
Responsible, mature young adults,
With their way to make in the world.
I love all of them, and so I lag behind;
I do not want to intrude in these moments;
Much as they make me welcome,
This is their world...and not totally mine.
But...any one of them has only to crook a finger...
And I'll come running, halfway across the world.
Love is a strange presence in one's heart;
It takes one out of oneself,
And makes one live, quite happily, for others, sometimes.
