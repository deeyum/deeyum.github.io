<a href="http://fotodreamz.blogspot.com/"> Mahesh </a> and I decided we would go to Lalbagh quite early, so he picked me up and we went off to see what we could see.

Well, almost the first thing that struck me was the answer to the question, "Why are we here?" which appeared like this:

The gentleman sporting the tee had no objection to my taking a photo of it, and told me he had got it somewhere in 4th T block, Jayanagar!

We  went around the lake, and were rewarded by these views of the LITTLE EGRET, clearly showing its characterisitic yellow feet:

A single Ficus tree in the park rewarded us with KOELS (remember the tail-of-the-koel that I had posted on


http://deponti.livejournal.com/219505.html

...well, here's a full Koel, finally:

 We saw DRONGOS, and this pretty WHITE-CHEEKED BARBET feeding on the figs:

The peepal tree had fresh new leaves, glinting copper in the sunlight:

And I loved the bark pattern on this tree-trunk:

I liked these flowers and fruits:

It was from the family Euphorbiacae, but I don't know what it is called in common parlance:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2307806336/" title="what that tree is scientifically called by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2307806336_c6b349b175_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="what that tree is scientifically called" /></a>


A couple of Drongos and a CHESTNUT-TAILED STARLING made quite a nice silhouette with  this pretty vine:

At this point, off we went to check on SSO, and the SPOTTED OWLETS were there, nestling (pun intended) together:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2307800314/" title="1-2-3 ! Lalbagh 010308 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/2307800314_a17bbc18cc_o.jpg" width="480" height="428" alt="1-2-3 ! Lalbagh 010308" /></a>


Now <lj user="amoghavarsha"> and Pavitra joined us, wanting to see the <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/318684.html"> MOTTLED WOOD OWL </a>

But that bird had an attitude problem that day. It just sat there like this and refused to move:

Very frustrating! We came back, were lucky to have a JUNGLE MYNA posing for us on a nearby tree:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2307790430/" title="jungle myna lalbagh 010308 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2159/2307790430_3c492b0488_o.jpg" width="371" height="480" alt="jungle myna lalbagh 010308" /></a>



And on we went, to wait interminably for breakfast at <a href="http://local.google.co.in/?hl=en&amp;q=Mavalli+Tiffin+Room&amp;near=Bengaluru,+Karnataka&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;latlng=12954783,77585406,16020419588994111190">   MTR </a> (I am never going there again)...and came back home, satisfied and somewhat tired from the very bright sunshine!
