On Christmas Day, I went to the 4th Sunday outing of BngBirds, which I had organized this month at Hoskote Lake. It was foggy, and I got some mist-erious shots:

Amongst other things, I noticed this godman getting ready for his day, donning the accoutrements of his trade (sorry, religion seems to be as much a profession these days as any other more-usual one!)

He had an assistant, who did not seem to need as much adornment as he did.

I asked them if I could take photographs, and he and his assistant nodded and carried on with their makeup. Everything...the "rudrAksha" beads, the "vibhUti", the "sindUr"...was being applied carefully.

I got a strange, half-suspicious look when they realized I was taking more than one photograph! So I stopped and went on my way.

What are the lives of these people like, and how do they eke a living? I will never know...we live in the same city, but on different planets!
