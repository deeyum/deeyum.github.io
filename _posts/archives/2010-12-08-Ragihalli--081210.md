This morning, Shreeram and I went with John Callaghan, who's visiting from Milton Keynes, UK, to Ragihalli. Unfortunately, we had a very late start and that meant that sightings were quite low....but we still managed quite an interesting time!

This

PIED BUSHCHAT

opened the proceedings, on the barbed wire:

We stopped at the sheet rock area, and John put up his scope. Alas, we did not have our usual luck with raptors here, and he just got a pair of Rufous-tailed Larks to spot!

Meanwhile, Shreeram was photographing this

ROBBER FLY:

A migrant that we were able to show John was the

BROWN SHRIKE:

We then took him to the Ragihalli Pond, where once again, the resident Oriental Honey Buzzard, the Spotted Owlets, and the Small Blue Kingfishers all absented themselves...but this beautiful

PADDYFIELD PIPIT 

posed quite comfortably!

I tried to take a picture of the spider at the centre of this sparkling web, but there was too much breeze:

I got this pic of mating

DRAGONFLIES:

My Ragihalli friend Puttamma's restaurant was open; on the way to the pond, I'd asked them to make hot idlis, and here are John, and our driver, Srinivasa, enjoying them:

Puttamma was away, but her daughter-in-law, Saraswathi, holding little Deepika on her hip, served us hospitably!


We were very lucky, on the way back home, to sight a 

BLUE-BEARDED BEE-EATER

which is not common at all. Here's the only shot I was able to get:

I showed John this home (the name was "English County") and remarked that for everyone, not just an Englishman, his home is his castle!

It was very nice to be able to get John's impressions of our city and country (he says Mumbai traffic is far worse than Bangalore's!) and we wish him and his wife a safe journey home tomorrow.
