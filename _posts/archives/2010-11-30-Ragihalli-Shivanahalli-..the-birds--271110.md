When Hrishikesh, Prajakta, Tharangini and I went on the road to Ragihalli and Shivanahalli, we started out with dark, overcast skies, and a complete lack of birding activity..to the point where we started wondering if we should just turn tail and go back home! But our first stop, near a temple, was rather productive; surprisingly, we found a lot of yellow birds together: White-eyes, Ioras, and the

EURASIAN GOLDEN ORIOLES

<lj-cut text="more birds">

Almost immediately, on one of the small teak trees, I, er, spotted this

SPOTTED OWLET

peeping out:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7065.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7065.jpg" border="0" alt="owlet peep 271110"></a>

A crow promptly chased it into the peepal tree under which the small shrine was, and from there, it looked at us alertly:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7068.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7068.jpg" border="0" alt="spotted owlet 2711110"></a>

Right opposite the shrine, we had the usual "in-the-leaves" view of these two

GREATER COUCALS

skulking and hiding themselves as much as possible!

Throughout the outing, we saw only this lone

EURASIAN COLLARED DOVE:

We then went to the Ragihalli sheet rock, and there was a lone 

JERDON'S BUSHLARK

very surprisingly, the bird sat perfectly still, and flew off only after several minutes:

The sheet-rock area then lived up to its usual reputation, with this

EGYPTIAN VULTURE

soaring past overhead:

At several places, we had good sightings of the

SHIKRA:

This

PADDYFIELD PIPIT

let us watch it for a while:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7151.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7151.jpg" border="0" alt="pdyfld pipt 271110"></a>

Here it is, eating its breakfast:

The lack of lighting ensured that all I got of the various raptors were silhouette shots. Here are a couple of raptors; 

<a href="http://wildwanderer.com"> Karthik </a>

says this might be one of the 

SPOTTED EAGLES:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7217.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7217.jpg" border="0" alt="un id raptor"></a>


this is probably the

<strike> SHORT-TOED SNAKE EAGLE</strike>
:

Update, Dipu feels this is probably a

BOOTED EAGLE:

The silhouette of the

ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD

of course, is better known to me:

So we ended our outing pretty satisfied with all that we'd seen, and the excellent breakfast provided by my "lady hotelier" at Ragihalli, and a light lunch at Bannerghatta Circle!
