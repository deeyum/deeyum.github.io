KM's cousin, Raju Srikumar,  put up a lot of family photographs on FB, and I downloaded these....

Here's KM and his family (I think the youngest brother wasn't yet born!)..this must be circa 1960:

Here I am, with AM (who's definitely less than a year old, so this must be early 1979), in Santhome, in Chennai:

Here's my father, holding AM, in Bompas Road, Kolkata, in September 1979:

The photo below is from October 1979; it was also taken in Santhome.

Here's a pic where my brother seems to have joined all of us. As <LJ user="itsalouwelylife"> says, probably faking the "good boy" look before going out on the town! I was lucky to have a brother and brother in laws who were on excellent terms..and in my mind, there was no difference between them...my brothers in law, too, were extremely affectionate.

Memories suddenly surfaced today...they are both happy and painful. Life has always been a mixture of the good and the bad, but the good has always predominated, and I am fortunate, and grateful for that!
