Since I was able to go birding to Bheemannakuppe kere on Saturday, and to the Ragihalli sheet rock/pond area on Sunday, I'd better combine the two for my field report...


My trip to Bheemannakuppe kerE (kerE means, lake or pond in Kannada) on Saturday was with Abhisheka Gopal, Anjali Anantharam, S R Gopalan, Girish Mayachari, Harsha Joshi, Sangeetha Kadur, and Suma.... and the group on Sunday, to Ragihalli, consisted of a member of the Madras Naturalists' Society, Padmanabhan, and his friends Sandhya, visiting from New York, and Kavita and Rajesh from Bangalore. The last three were coming out birding for the very first time!

One raptor that we saw on both days was the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Honey_Buzzard"> ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD </a> :

At Bheemannakuppe kere (kerE means pond or lake in Kannada), we spotted the 


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-toed_Eagle"> SHORT-TOED SNAKE EAGLE </a>

I ask you, when the raptor is flying at that height, which <strike> senseless person </strike> learned scientist thought to name it after the size of its toes, I wonder?

Here's a view of the bird high above:

I've already posted about the 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/616858.html"> BLACK-WINGED KITE </a>

But even a juvenile

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahminy_Kite"> BRAHMINY KITE </a>

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9513.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9513.jpg" border="0" alt="brahminy kite juvenile 051209"></a>

looked so beautiful ....and adult and juvenile cavorted in the air together:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9519.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9519.jpg" border="0" alt="brahminy kite adult and juvenile 051209"></a>

but apart from the raptors, there were several birds that caught our attention, and were caught by my camera....

After the kite the next bird that we saw flocks of, was the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_Starling"> ROSY PASTOR </a>


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9472.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9472.jpg" border="0" alt="rosy pastor 051209"></a>

at the kere, this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Cormorant"> LITTLE CORMORANT </a>

was telling its friend the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_Egret"> CATTLE EGRET </a>

 about the size of the fish that got away! (Notice the disbelieving look on the Egret's face!)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9489.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9489.jpg" border="0" alt="egret and cormorant 051209"></a>

The Egrets seemed to like congregating:




Even "common" birds like the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-cheeked_Barbet"> WHITE-CHEEKED BARBET </a>

looked so beautiful with food in their beaks!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9477.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9477.jpg" border="0" alt="barbet with food 051209"></a>

Overhead, this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-billed_Stork"> OPEN-BILLED STORK </a>

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9500.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9500.jpg" border="0" alt="painted stork 061209"></a>

I checked to see...but it wasn't carrying an open-billed  baby!

We saw, and heard, several LARKS singing, and then this

<a href=""> PADDYFIELD PIPIT </a>

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9610.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9610.jpg" border="0" alt="paddyfield pippit 061209"></a>

decided to imitate a lark..it kept singing and singing! You can see its the pinkish-red in its mouth...my friend 

<a href="http://toroid.org/ams/"> AMS </a>

says that all Paddyfiled Pipits have them...so this is a further diagnostic for me to learn!


A very unusual sighting, according to
<a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com"> Karthik </a>

was this  bird that flew past:

He gently prodded me that my id of GLOSSY IBIS was wrong, and lo and behold, my "Grimmskipp" showed me that it was, actually, the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stork">BLACK STORK </a>

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9544.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9544.jpg" border="0" alt="glossy ibis b kuppe kere 051209"></a>


A very rare sighting for the outskirts of Bangalore, Karthik informs me.


A group of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot-billed_Duck"> SPOT-BILLED DUCKS </a> 

that were on the water, took to their wings:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9533.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9533.jpg" border="0" alt="spot-billed ducks in flight 051209"></a>

that flash of green on their wings is wonderful.


The 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_Egret"> CATTLE EGRETS </a>

like to congregate!

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9529.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9529.jpg" border="0" alt="egret convocation 051209"></a>

and they made a lovely picture upon the face of the waters:

On the way back, we enjoyed the sight of these two

<a href=""> INDIAN SILVERBILLS </a>

having a great bath!

The Ragihalli trip gave me a lifer (that is, a bird sighted for the first time.)


On the Ragihalli sheet rock, we saw this

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufous-tailed_Lark"> RUFOUS-TAILED LARK </a>

running about unconcerned by us:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9630.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9630.jpg" border="0" alt="rufous-tailed lark ragihalli sheet rock 061209"></a>

On the net next to the temple by the pond, this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Bushchat"> PIED BUSHCHAT </a> female

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_9633.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_9633.jpg" border="0" alt="pied bushchat female 061209"></a>

sat upon the net in the most endearing manner.

I had id'd these Munias as BLACK-HEADED MUNIAS while watching them; it was only when I got home and saw, on the photographs, the streaks on their bodies and their other characteristic, that I realized we'd been looking at

<a href=""> WHITE-RUMPED MUNIAS </a>!

I leave you with this colourful scene of the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-breasted_Kingfisher"> WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER </a> 

at Ragihalli kere, adding its dash of blue to the greenery, and the white and pink of the lantanas and waterlilies:
