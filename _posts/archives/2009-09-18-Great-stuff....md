Yesterday I went to listen to 

<a href="http://www.slso.org/concert/"> the St.Louis Symphony Orchestra </a>

performing free on the hill in front of the Art Museum...



Today and tomorrow, I will be going to

<a href="http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm"> the Balloon Glow and the Balloon Race </a>

I remember the last time I went for this event, I didn't know one end of a camera from the other....!
