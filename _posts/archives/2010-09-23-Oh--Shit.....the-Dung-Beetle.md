Shit..is not a dirty word in Nature. It's as much a part of the environment as a beautiful flower, and has a lot of uses in the ecosystem. Traditionally, we've always used dried cowdung (politely called cowpats) as fuel, and my aunts used to consider the dung of temple elephants as a curative for cracks in the feet. "Panchakavyam" or the five products of a cow, included its dung, for medicinal and ritual purposes.

Often dung provides a fertile material to nourish other life forms, such as this mushroom growing out of elephant dung:

Nothing typifies the role of dung as a nurturing material, though,  as much as the wonderful activities of the

We got the opportunity to watch one when we were driving back from the home stay in Chik Yelchetti; since Girish said he had seen something, we stopped the car and I immediately recognized the beetle:

It was riveting to watch the little insect rolling the dung ball industriously along:

Ravi told us that it takes the beetle half an hour or an hour to make the ball of dung, and then it begins rolling it along:

It's amazing, too, that the beetle is rolling along the ball with its back legs, and it's actually travelling in reverse...so counter-intuitive for us human beings!

Here's a short video of the action:

For naturalists, too, shit (or scat or dung or faeces or whatever it's called) has its uses. While we were walking, Ravi, our guide at the home-stay in Bandipur, identified this Fox scat, and looked at it carefully for pointers to its recent diet:

In Daroji, too, Samad Kottur had showed us bear scat, and also showed us undigested parts of beetles which gave a clue to both the bears' diet and to the other insects found in the region.

So...poop is quite interesting and useful in Nature! :)
