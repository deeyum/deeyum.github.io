I've been interested in, and involved with,

<a href="http://magicpuddles.com/"> Magic Puddles </a>

a daycare and children's activity centre, for a while now, since I did a project with the children about trees. And having done the

a little while ago, I wanted to take the children there, too; so this morning, Viji and I rounded up some children and off we went!

We started at the Brigade Millenium arch entrance:

And as we went, I pointed out various interesting things to them. Here they are, keenly observing a grasshopper!

The children were full of curiosity...their sentences always seem to end in either question marks or exclamation marks! We were joined by 

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/puttenahallilakeonline/"> Usha Rajagopalan of the Puttenahalli Neighbourhood Lake Improvement Trust </a>

who, with her band of tireless volunteers, has been maintaining the lake...and saving it from almost-certain disaster.

They looked at various insects, trees (that PNLIT has planted, and others, too) and birds...and Usha explained various things about the lake.


She gave each child a pencil to write or sketch with (several of the children were already writing down what they saw, or sketching it!), and I asked everyone to pose for a group photo:
