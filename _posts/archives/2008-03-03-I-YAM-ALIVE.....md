Yes, boysngulls,ladiesngenmun, and all others...I am not dead, but my internet connection nearly was. Took a lot of help from <LJ user="anushsh"> and <LJ user="sainath"> (the latter came home to spend a little time and wound up giving me a lot of help as usual)....to get this thing to the point where I can actually type more than 2 lines without the darnfool thing collapsing on me.

Since that is not lady-like language, I would like to post this very beautiful wildflower that I photographed in Srirangapatna on the Golden Chariot trip.

On Saturday I had a fantastic time in Lalbagh with Mahesh, <LJ user="amoghavarsha"> and Pavitra; on Sunday, a phenomenally productive birding trip to T G Halli (Thippe Gondena Halli if you want the full name) with <LJ user="sainath">, <LJ user="shivakumar_l">, <LJ user="anushsh">,  and I met some very good photographers and saw a variety of birds, including some majestic raptors...here's a BOOTED EAGLE (sorry, that acme of bird-id-ers, Abhijit Menon-Sen, says he was mistaken, my original id of TAWNY EAGLE was right):

Just beginning to post many other pictures to Flickr, so if this <strike> hell-sent frustration </strike> internet connection keeps up, will be able to catch up soon...Hope all of you had as great a time as I did, over the weekend....two birding trips, a great play, two yum lunches with friends, leisurely walk in the gloaming with spouse....
