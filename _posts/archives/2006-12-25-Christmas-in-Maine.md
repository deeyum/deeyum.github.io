We took a very early morning flight to Portland, and here we are, in the home of the S's, a lovely, warm, welcoming home. LS's mother, at 83, has flown in from Florida..she still looks so exquisitely beautiful. We just finished a late lunch and I am typing on the bridegroom-to-be's laptop....Have to go and gift-wrap stuff now, and I am pretty glad that there is NO snow around here, however cold it is!

Will post a  few pictures soon, I hope...but until then...all of you....enjoy yourselves!
