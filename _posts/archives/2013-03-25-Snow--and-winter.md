Snow is supposed to be white;
But many colours seen to hide in it.
The snow catches the band of the prism:
Indeed, it can even widen it.

It's a lesson to me not to assume
That's anyone's life is a bland white.
They may just be balancing, wisely,
All the colours of the light.

I opened the door to Spring.
But it was Winter that I let in.
I wanted the green and the flowers.
But it was all white in a few hours....
