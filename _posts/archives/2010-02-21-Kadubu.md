One of the dishes from Mangalore cuisine that I like is 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Karnataka"> Kadubu </a>

It's listed in that link as a fried dish, too, but the one I'm talking about is a steamed dish without fillings....

Here it is, steamed in the banana-leaf wrapping:

The spirally-wrapped leaf is then removed:

and it's then enjoyed with the coconut chutney and the sambar.

My mouth is watering, thinking of it so far away....!
