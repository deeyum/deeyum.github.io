As I returned
From an outing, back home
I chanced upon this sight
Of a superhero on the roam.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/34093229655/in/dateposted-friend/" title="IMG_1574"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3950/34093229655_01ede6e140_z.jpg" width="640" height="422" alt="IMG_1574"></a>

I didn't click the owner,
A proud-looking man, whose
Idea it was, to
Put the dog in four shoes.

Though the pet seemed OK
And actually did strut
Proudly along, I'd never
Dress up any mutt!

A dog should be a dog
I feel, not an ape
Of any human being..
Whatever size and shape!
