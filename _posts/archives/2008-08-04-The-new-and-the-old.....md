I had been to someone's 80th birthday celebrations on Saturday;it was a couple, this time, and it was nice to watch them surrounded by friends and relatives....and at the festivity, I took this photograph of youth and age..

How did the English prefix "grand" come to be associated with this relationship of a child's child, or a parent's parent? Does anyone know (no, don't tell me to google it.)

That baby in the photograph...reminds me of Charles Schulz's description of his creation, Charlie Brown...that ROUND head...you could put a compass caliper point on! that little girl's nose and draw a circle and the head would fit perfectly...and not to miss that tiny finger! :)
