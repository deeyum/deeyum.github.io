Thank you, <LJ user="shortindiangirl">, for sending this, from some memorial service:

I'm Free
------------
 
Don't grieve for me, for now I am free,
I'm following the path God laid for me
I took His hand when I heard Him call,
I turned my back and left it all.
 
I could not stay another day
To laugh, to love to work or play,
Tasks left undone must stay that way.
I found peace at the close of day.
 
If my parting has left a void,
Then fill it with remembered joy.
A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss;
Oh yes, these things I too will miss.
 
Be not burdened with times of sorrow;
I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow.
My life's been full, I've savored much;
Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.
 
Perhaps my time seemed all too brief,
Don't lengthen it now with undue grief.
Lift up your heart and share with me.
