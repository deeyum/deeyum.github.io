I went to the company where KM consults, and the whole group was to leave for JLR, Dandeli. While waiting for them, I went around the campus and found several BEE-EATERS, RED-WHISKERED BULBULS, PURPLE SUNBIRDS,&nbsp; ROCK PIGEONS, and other such common birds all over. I saw this fellow try to have a drink from a slightly leaky tap...and I couldn't resist clicking!

Will post the rest of the pics soon....I took several of butterflies, dragonflies, wasps and ants...fascinating creatures!
