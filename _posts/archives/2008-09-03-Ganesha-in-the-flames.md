This is the pooja that I did at home:

But I was photographing the pooja that we had downstairs, on the lawn, common to all the apartments in the building; and I like to fancy that Ganesha was present in the flames of the hOmA:

With a little imagination, I can see the the elephant fan-ear on the right, the head, the single-tusk (Ganesha broke off the other tusk to write the epic, Mahabharata, as Vyasa declaimed it), the swelling belly (full of devotees' offerings!) to the lower left...!
