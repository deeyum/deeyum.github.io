The mornings have,quite suddenly (with a couple of days of heavy rain) turned very cold; yesterday,since it was the weekend, I waited until there was some light before I set out for my walk. 
I'm glad I went out when I did, or I'd have mist this:

Water in any form, and light,in any form, are both playmates and adversaries. Their interplay is always a visual treat....
