Why...
Do I want to try
To be the official scribe
As the cyclists pedal furiously
Across the hills?
Because...
Through the course...
I'd able to describe
All I'd experience, and see.
The wheres, the whens, the hows, and the whys...
The thrills, the chills, the spills
As the bikers sail across the Blue
Mountains...trying adventure for size...
Take some pictures: videos, too!
I could see their dreams 
With my eyes, and write
How they climbed slopes and forded streams;
How they exchanged anecdotes,
Danced together, sang some notes....
I'd share their points of view;
Record their moods, both heavy and light
Every little incident;
The pedal that fell off, the wheel that bent:
The final push, the incredible thrill,
Of conquering distance with one's will....
Click their faces, as they passed
The victorious finishing line at last...
Have, at the end, a memorable journal
Of the cyclists' efforts diurnal.
I want to be the Official Blogger(if you please)
Of the 2009 Tour of the Nilgiris!
