One of the things I love to do is to go wandering around the market area; and I found a lot of shapes...

Here are the papayas. It fascinates me that they ripen in this fashion, with the greener areas making star shapes:

Then there are the banana leaves, bundled up for sale:

And the fried snacks, all lined up in these canisters:

And the lovely shapes of the shiny capsicums (locum pl locii...capsicum pl capsicii??)

Ooh, I am enjoying this everywhere-go camera sooo much!
