two of your friends fall out....one continues in contact with you, the other moves far away, in more senses than one. The one close to you delights in giving details of how evil the other one is....and you can't bring yourself to believe that someone whom you liked and respected so much  can be really like that...the fallout causes ructions in a solid group that has been friends for years, and disrupts everything... love of money in business is indeed the root of a lot of evil. You don't know whom to believe and it is upsetting to speculate every time you see the other friend.
