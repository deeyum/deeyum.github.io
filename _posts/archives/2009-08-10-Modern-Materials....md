Mrs Bird: I really like these new materials one gets nowadays....the nest is so much sturdier, and it will be more comfortable for the babies too...

Mr Bird: I'm a little worried about the drainage though...rainwater might stagnate...

Mrs Bird: Oh, but it also gives such a nice, novel effect to our architecture, you know! I'm sure we'll be quite the envy of all the rest....

Mr Bird: (smirks smugly) I thought of you, dear, when I picked up this material and brought it home....
