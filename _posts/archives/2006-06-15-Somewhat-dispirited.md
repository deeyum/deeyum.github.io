There is SO much that I don't know...SO much to learn about SO many things...there is a sudden feeling of "how much time do I have left?" and the answer is, "I don't know, but definitely, more than half --or even two-thirds-- of my&nbsp; life is over"...and I haven't learnt very much.

Well...I suppose I should be grateful that I am healthy,&nbsp;happy, and comfortable enough to sit and worry about such things!
