The lyrics:


ajeeb dAsthAn hai yEh
kahAn shuru kahAn khatham
yeh manzilEin kaun see
na wOh samajh sakEy na hum


yeh rOshnee ke sAth kyOn
dhuAn utthA chirAg sEy
yeh khwAb dEkhthee hoon meyn
ki jag padi hoon khwAb sEy


mubArakEin thUmhEy ki thUm (that's the "U" pronounced as in "book")
kisee key noor hO gayEy
kiseeke ithnEy pAs hO
ki sabsEy dhoor hO gayEy

kiseeka pyAr lEyke thUm
nayA jahAn basAogEy
yeh shAm jab bhi AyEgee
thUm hamkO yAAd AogEy


Translation (if anyone has a better version do give it!)

What a weird tale this is...
Where does it begin, where does it end?
What are the destinations?
Neither of us understands


Why, with the light,
Does the smoke arise from the lamp?
I dream...
..that I have woken up from the dream


Congratulations to you..you have
Become the light of someone's life
You have become so close to someone
That you are far away from everyone else


With someone's love, you
Will create a new world
Whenever (the memory of) this evening comes
I will think of you




The heroine is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meena_Kumari"> Meena Kumari </a>, who was a great tragedienne...in her later years, she was fat, a diva in her behaviour...her life itself was very unhappy.

The Wikipaedia link is really nice...it includes some "shAyri" (couplet verse poetry) that she herself wrote.
