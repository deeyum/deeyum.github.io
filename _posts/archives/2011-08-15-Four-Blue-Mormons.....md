I wish I could have photographed all the butterflies we saw, but this was one of the best...and I'm glad I got a video!

I'll be posting photographs on my Facebook albums soon. LJ continues to be very capricious. I was able to comment on ONE LJ friend's post today before it siezed up again, and I started getting spam comments...


Rohit Girotra, this one's for you :)
