On the spur of the moment, my friend Rosita Sequiera came by with her son Mark and picked me up, and off we went; I wanted to show her the magnificient trees of Hulimangala.

She'd brought some nice tea in that flask!

We started the evening with a beautiful

SHORT-TOED SNAKE EAGLE

soaring above:

Mark, who's done well in his exams, was all smiles:

I took Rosita down the avenue of the wonderful giants, which feels like a cathedral to me:

Everywhere on the tall trees there were beehives, and I clicked one under construction:

The sun behind the clouds was an amazing sight, and I could not stop clicking the Fingers of God:

Though the lake nearby was nearly dry, it had a beauty of its own:

The figs on the Banyan tree were an invitation for many birds:

You can see how beautiful is the camouflage of the

ROSE-RINGED PARAKEET

with its body against the leaves, and its beak against the figs:

These two majestic Ficus trees are my landmark to turn off on the road to Hulimangala:

We sighted the Mottled Wood Owl, too, being chased around by the Mynas, then the Parakeets, and then the Kites!
