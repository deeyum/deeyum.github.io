While we were waiting interminably (3pm to 5.30pm!) for a bus from Dadigal village to Denkanikotta on Saturday, Geetanjali decided to try out a "local" drink...

Notice how proudly the bottle announces that it is a "product of the Coca Cola company"...I doubt very much if Coca Cola have ever heard of Sun Kola!

Kola (koLA) in Kannada also means pond....so...a sun pond...well, it tasted of grapes, and did quench the thirst for a while, I guess!
