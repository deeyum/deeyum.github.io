On our last day at the Lake of the Ozarks, Memorial Day, we decided to go on a short hike...the hike had to be short because of two reasons....several things (including a very late night the previous evening!) made a very late start, and it was rather hot and humid.


On the way, from the car,when we looked down,  we spotted some turtles:

When we looked up, we spotted some

TURKEY VULTURES:

The bluffs on the way had been graded to enable the roads to be built:

We stopped at the Lake of the Ozarks National Park:

We decided to go to the stables there, and take the trail.

We saw a tepee, rather bedraggled:

We walked a short while on this trail, but all we seemed to be doing was to avoid horse poop, and the dug-up path that the horses' hooves had left; so we decided to try another trail instead. This made us later still, and we opted for the shortest rrail possible, the Lake View Bend Trail:

Alas, it was bird siesta time, and by the time I did see some birds in the trees on our way back, it was very late, and I had to walk really fast, so there was no bird photography at all! But as it was, I dallied to photograph some mushrooms:

I got to photograph only one butterfly, but there were several more that were, alas, in "flitting" mode and which I could not follow!

Several wildflowers rewarded our walk (though there was a good breeze, it was still a humid and rather uncomfortable affair, and we were getting really hungry!

It was lovely to see this bed of green:

Even when we went to Jefferson City later in the evening, on our way home, there were some lovely flowers to see:

As we walked around, I spotted this beautiful dragonfly, which looked rather like our Pied Paddyfield Skimmer back home:

Right up on the Capitol building, I spotted a 

HOUSEFINCH:

On the trail, of course, were the mammals dearest to me....here they are, resting briefly at the lakeshore:

You can see them through the shade of the trees:

It was quite an enjoyable hike, though it certainly delayed us quite badly on our trip home!
