I started from Bangalore International Airport, which looked beautiful in the middle of the night:

<lj-cut text="The journey, the views, the landmarks....">

I reached Paris CDG with a bad seat and no sleep, but at the departure gate for the flight to Stockholm, I was entertained by three children:

They were busy having a luggage fight, while an infant looked on!

A colourful caterpillar was also a neck-rest:

CDG airport made a beautiful monochrome:

We flew over the lush greenery of summer:

The sea views were lovely, too:

A highway snaked through the green:

I arrived at Stockholm:

It was as if this was what Sweden was telling me:

Without Deepak's help, I could not have managed those heavy suitcases. He was fitter by the time we reached the Vastare home!

On the bus from the airport to the Central Station (from where Deepak and I took a train to Goteborg), I couldn't help clicking, in spite of drooping with fatigue:

A nearly-full moon rose:

I loved the sleek look of the trains:

The station, too, was so pretty!

Sumana's kitchen was as hospitable and inviting as they both are:

I was dead tired by now, and closed my day!

Let me close with these beautiful sculptures in the Goteborg Main Square:
