LJ has not been opening up at all for me for the past few days...but just now...I must have said the LJ equivalent of "Open Sesame"....

Let me post quickly before the door closes!

Email to the bngbirds egroup:

I've been wanting to participate in the Kaiga Bird Marathon for a
while. I must say, it intrigued me that there was a birding event in a
place where there is a nuclear reactor; one's image of the triple-leaf
radiation "fan" symbol doesn't go with any thoughts on the environment
or "good" ecology. Recent nuclear meltdown events haven't helped this
mental image, either. For this very reason, I determined to go to
Kaiga and "see for myself".

Harish Chandra and I decided to go a day earlier and get in a little
more birding in this town set in the Western Ghats.We decided to take
the scenic route and chugged along the Konkan coast to Karwar,

<lj-cut text="more about the trip, and the event">

Maritime Museum, Karwar.

 from where we took a bus to Kaiga.

 Even along the way, there were good bird
sightings...the "plateau of the south", which has got anglicized from
"Dakshin" to "Deccan", showed itself its myriad different habitats.

When we checked into Subhadra Hotel,

we were met by Mr Mohandas

of NPCL (Nuclear Power Corporation Ltd.). He has been one of the untiring organizers of the event. He gave us a tour of Kaiga township...

Old Ramalingeshwara temple, Kaiga Township.

Kadra Dam.

so green and fresh, even at the end of the winter season. He then took us to the Kaiga Timber Depot, where, amongst other beauties, 
the

Malabar (Crimson-fronted) Barbet

 the Velvet-fronted Nuthatch, tick-tocking its body on the branches

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16560019942" title="IMG_2217 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8630/16560019942_2f2e480464_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2217"></a>


 and an in-the-dark duet between two  Brown Hawk Owls (one of which I clicked in the dark)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15938572124" title="IMG_2226 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/15938572124_78112f43fd_z.jpg" width="640" height="446" alt="IMG_2226"></a>

thrilled us...not forgetting the Malabar Giant Squirrel.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16374844499" title="IMG_2212 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/16374844499_5e037412ac_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2212"></a>

the Kadra Dam was beautiful to see, by night, 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15940952973" title="IMG_2237 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/15940952973_6d9c6b16d9_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2237"></a>

as we headed back to Mohandas' home, where we met his talented wife Manjula, and bright children, Anshu and Dhriti.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15940959343" title="IMG_2247 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7378/15940959343_094091aaa2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2247"></a>

Here's a video of 2-year-old Dhriti id'ing the birds in her father's book!She's the youngest birder I've ever met.

(I don't know if everyone can see this)

I saw this plaque of the Kaiga Atomic Power Plant, Unit 2 (we didn't have permission, or the time, to visit!)


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16375221857" title="IMG_2248 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/16375221857_bb19458cb5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2248"></a>

For dinner, we picked up some fresh seawater and freshwater fish (Katla and Pedi) for Harish.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16374868669" title="IMG_2252 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8666/16374868669_69474fa7c4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2252"></a>

and then went to the only eatery that was open, but where the proprietor kept a very clean kitchen

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16565666281" title="IMG_2262 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/16565666281_0751b5edc5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2262"></a>

and affectionately served us a great dinner.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16559491111" title="IMG_2256 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8599/16559491111_629f1f950c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2256"></a>

The next morning, we set off to walk along the road that leads to the
Nisarga Guest House (of NPCL).

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16541330106" title="IMG_2281 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7383/16541330106_65f11279ed_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2281"></a>

 This cow, feeding her calf, typifies rural India to me...great family values, and a lot of cleanliness issues!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15944766254" title="IMG_2274 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/15944766254_15cbc173a1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2274"></a>

 We stopped for breakfast at the same eatery, and saw this emerald-eyed cat, which reminded me of the Black Panther that had been sighted last year after the same event.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379655988" title="IMG_2261 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8570/16379655988_cf83610a34_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2261"></a>

Here's the owner with the cat...the cat is named, Rama and the owner is Lakshmana!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16567344235" title="IMG_2269 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8636/16567344235_bc29f30e57_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2269"></a>

A Shikra sat, looking for breakfast.

We went past the Day Sellers' Market,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16381040399" title="IMG_2278 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8661/16381040399_d3878e6cc0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2278"></a>

noticed a Strangler Fig in convoluted designs,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16381409917" title="IMG_2279 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7445/16381409917_12138a9aa6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2279"></a>

went past a little shrine.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16541334736" title="IMG_2308 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/16541334736_e1e4d44eb6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2308"></a>

As we crossed over a dry ditch, what should entrance us (pun intended, this was our 'entrance' to birding  that morning!) but a perfectly quiet, but blue-as-magic Malabar
non-Whistling Thrush!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379878850" title="IMG_2300 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/16379878850_786ea2d8d4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2300"></a>

Our birding began in earnest, and we spotted these Chestnut-tailed Starlings:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15947144873" title="IMG_2282 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/15947144873_e0bb54c654_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2282"></a>

A flock of Wire-tailed Swallows swooped and occasionally sat on the ground:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15947149633" title="IMG_2315 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/15947149633_72c416c686_z.jpg" width="640" height="444" alt="IMG_2315"></a>

A White-throated Kingfisher sat around:

A Black-headed Cuckoo-shrike lady delighted us

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16566230712" title="IMG_2321 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8572/16566230712_ce351eab99_z.jpg" width="640" height="445" alt="IMG_2321"></a>

as did several Common Ioras

This one was feasting on the flowers of a tree that I could not identify

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16541549076" title="IMG_2404 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8660/16541549076_de41b2ecc1_z.jpg" width="640" height="472" alt="IMG_2404"></a>

lots of Bulbuls

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16381421477" title="IMG_2327 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7333/16381421477_f2364310fd_z.jpg" width="640" height="443" alt="IMG_2327"></a>

many Munias

Orange Minivets

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15944993154" title="IMG_2406 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/15944993154_ea0eaee6c3_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2406"></a>

Two Black-hooded Orioles had a loud difference of opinion in the golden bamboo thicket.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15944783564" title="IMG_2347 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8561/15944783564_aa6df16119_z.jpg" width="640" height="450" alt="IMG_2347"></a>

So many birds have ruby eyes!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16381424237" title="IMG_2350 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7458/16381424237_3eaede2309_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2350"></a>

These Green Bee-eaters have them, too:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379681128" title="IMG_2356 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7457/16379681128_30636afea7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2356"></a>

The golden, van-Gogh-looking grassland/field area near C-5 buildings

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16541345676" title="IMG_2362 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7281/16541345676_4f76061b9e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2362"></a>

 was most productive. We saw the Eursasian Blackbird (I think eBird calls it the Indian
Blackbird now?)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16565694751" title="IMG_2365 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16565694751_547ff61722_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2365"></a>

I got the tubular tongue of the Purple Sunbird:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16381446087" title="IMG_2400 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/16381446087_0956249b91_z.jpg" width="640" height="438" alt="IMG_2400"></a>

A Pale-billed Flowerpecker posed for us.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15944806844" title="IMG_2401 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7413/15944806844_5bc0078f6e_z.jpg" width="640" height="409" alt="IMG_2401"></a>

The mango trees were in full bloom everywhere.

I saw the architectural marvel of a pasted-together Weaver Ants' nest:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379884868" title="IMG_2402 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8679/16379884868_ed61df45ab_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2402"></a>

Kaveri and Soumya posed for me as they went to school.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379696228" title="IMG_2384 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/16379696228_b9301696d4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2384"></a>

We had a masal dosa lunch

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16379909250" title="IMG_2390 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7287/16379909250_8209d6672a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2390"></a>

 at Mr Bhatt's eatery, which is hidden next to a plastic goods store. This young man, deaf and dumb, is totally self-reliant; Mr Bhatt communicates easily with him, and he serves the customers with a smile.

It was nice to see my portrait adorning a shop:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16565710881" title="IMG_2397 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7369/16565710881_36e0ee7da8_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2397"></a>

The evening was spent in meeting other birders who gathered for the
event on the morrow; we did feel that we could have gone off for a
birding trail! But it was still very enjoyable, meeting old friends
and making new ones. We admired Puttaraju's wonderful photographs
(we'd already seen a collection in Subhadra Hotel), and sightings of
the White-bellied Sea Eagle, flying low to the Kali river
backwaters,behind the guest house, as well as Mani's dusk sighting of
the Indian Pitta in the bushes, added to the happiness we felt.
