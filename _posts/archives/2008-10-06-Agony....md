Sometimes, the most intense agony is the one that has to be borne silently...my prayers are with someone who is suffering terribly right now.

I was struck by the serenity and peace of this scene on the first floor of "Dodda Mane", the 108-year-old house where "Malgudi Days" was shot. The books speak of reading, the chair at the window, of contemplation, peace, and a quiet pace of life....

A quiet scene, beautiful in its stillness...no TV, no video games, no hectic action. A place where a human being is not a human doing.
