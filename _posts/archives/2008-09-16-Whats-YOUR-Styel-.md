Got this just outside my hoem, sorry, home:

A fellow-blogger had commented once that we shouldn't be amused at such scenes as the people who spell so originally have not had the advantage of our kind of education...but....surely..."style"..?

What do *I* think about this guy's lapse? Someone else said it for me...
