Every now and then, the "experts" start fussing that the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottled_wood_owl"> Mottled Wood Owls </a>

of Lalbagh have "disappeared". Immediately, of course the birders and bird photographers of Bangalore are blamed (interestingly never the hundreds of walkers and visitors that go past the place where the owls are.)

So, after a couple of reports that the Owls could not be found, one of them delighted me in its usual copse behind the giant Bauhinia creeper.

The sexes are alike, according to the Wiki entry, so I don't know if this is a he or a she!

I took a short video as it hopped across, out of sight in the very low light.

The music is "Night Vision" which is what I needed to see the Owl in the low light...and the band playing it is Bird Creek, which, too, I thought appropriate!
