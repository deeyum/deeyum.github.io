She walks along the road
Calmly, with her headload
Balanced perfectly, her food
Carried in her hand.
Is her life as balanced?
What does she think, as she trudges along?
How far does she have to walk?
How often does she do this?
These questions occur to me..
I do not know what questions, what thoughts,
What issues dominate her life.
Life, it seems to me, is like this:
You pick up your load, and your sustenance,
And carry both along.
No idea what the next turn will bring.
The path winds forward, and you just keep walking...
Until the day you stagger, or drop.
