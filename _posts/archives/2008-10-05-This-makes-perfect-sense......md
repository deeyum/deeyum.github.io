To some birders, at some stratospheric level which I will never reach, the following statement makes immediate sense:


 the phoenicoptera with a chlorigaster


(Well, yes, I have to own that it *does* make sense to me, but only I recollect that some pigeons have green bellies (gastro - belly, stomach; chloro - green).

I am going to one day develop a taxonomy with a Sanskrit base not a Latin one! 

We are just back  a simply a-m-a-z-i-n-g trip to the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station. Stand by for VERY few birds, but butterflies, scorpions, frogs, snakes....and a wonderful village which has a 108-year house where the  wonderful TV  series, "Malgudi Days" was shot.

While I attempt to upload the hundreds of pics I got (I didn't take a laptop along, so I have a HUGE job ahead!), read about Malgudi Days:

 the writer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.K._Narayan"> R K Narayan </a> ,   

All the 39 episodes of Malgudi Days are available for online viewing  <a href="http://www.rajshri.com/malgudidays/index.asp"> here </a>.

Some lovely images, including the unforgettable sketches by R K Narayan's brother, the incredible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._K._Laxman"> R K Laxman </a>.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malgudi_Days"> the short stories  </a>, 

and even <a href="http://www.arjunprabhu.com/blog/archives/2005/11/15/malgudi-days-title-song/"> the beloved title song of the series </a>

OK, off to do Navarathri visits at friends' homes, back later!
