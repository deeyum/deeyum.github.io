This pass was in the news today as it has been thrown open for trade.... here we are, visiting it in Apr 2004!


Please notice the way my husband's beloved mistress hugs him much closer than I do....if I were called Canon he would be much more fond of me....it was only when he saw someone with an almost identical camera that he gave it to them and asked them to click a snap--and that too, AFTER he had stood in the spot and focussed and set things first!
