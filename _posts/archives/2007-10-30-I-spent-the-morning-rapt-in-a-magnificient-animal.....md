I saw the photograph yesterday, and the image stayed with me...by this morning, I knew that whatever else I did, or didn't do,today, I just simply HAD to sit down and sketch ...

At last, it is out of my system....that itch to bring out through my fingers and my pencil, what had captivated me.


Art...any form of it...is a demanding mistress. Today I had people coming to repair: a)the geyser container; b) the handle on the double-glazed window-frames; c) a leaking cistern....the workmen must have thought me crazy as I would nod at them and return to my desk in a most pre-occupied fashion!

For those of you who are interested, my tiger sketch is at

That sketch is much lighter than this...I should darken it, I suppose...
