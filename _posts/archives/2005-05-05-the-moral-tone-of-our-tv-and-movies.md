Why are we such mealy-mouthed hypocrites? Heroes are sooo mother- and father- and family- loving and marriage is soooo touted and all other relationships between a man and woman are frowned upon with shock and scandal and of course man-man or woman-woman relationships are NEVER dealt with...when Deepa Mehta's picture came out, there were people trying to set fire to the movie theatre in typical style...when are Indians going to grow out of Victorian hypocrisy and prudery and GROW UP???
