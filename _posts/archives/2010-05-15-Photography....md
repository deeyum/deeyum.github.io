Taking pictures is a popular pastime, as never before, after the advent of digital photography. It's now so easy to take pictures, and the results can be seen instantaneously, too.


You find a good perspective and pose your subjects...and while you snap them from in front, someone else photographs them from behind!

Sometimes you take turns with the camera; first one...

and then the other.....

Sometimes you do it for a living, and record videos while your subjects pose...

You need not photograph the people, sometimes their shadows are interesting, too!

You cannot resist it when the "fingers of God" peep through the clouds at sunset. You take sunset snaps with palm trees...

and without them....

Instead of just the evening light, you'd want to capture  people silhouetted against it, too....

But I must add the comment of one of the ladies who attended <LJ user="kalyan">'s photography workshop...."Oh! You mean, for digital photography,  you require a computer, too?!" I hope she did, ultimately, buy the camera as well as a computer!
