We went on a nature/birding walk to Kalena Agrahara today, and skirted the lake at IDBI Bank Layout. I was amazed to see several Nano cars parked, and rusting in the monsoon weather.

There must have been about sixty of the cars, parked all around.

At a conservative estimate of Rs.2 lakhs per car, that's Rs. 80 lakhs just wasting away.

I finally found this banner, saying that these cars apparently belong to this rental initiative:

The problem in our country seems to be, not lack of good initiatives, but keeping up with them. I have tried to call this number to find out why so many cars are rusting...and could not get through. I will try again on Monday (which should be a working day.) Â But meanwhile...would it not have been better to just donate these cars rather than let such an investment waste away in this fashion?

"Oh...this is a new AirBnB effort!" said my friend Rekha-Ram Lakshmanan, from St.Louis, when he saw the cars. "No," I riposted, "This is CarBnB!"

What a sad state of affairs. Can anyone throw any more light on this failed initiative?
