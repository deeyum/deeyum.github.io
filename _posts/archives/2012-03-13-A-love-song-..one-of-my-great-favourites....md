I find that lyrics that speak of the love between a man and a woman are very beautiful indeed, and in my language, Tamizh, it is as true as for any other language.

Here's a song from a very old Tamizh classic movie, "kAthalikka nEram illai" (there is no time for love)...where the lovers cannot be together, and they speak of their emotions and their longing.

(forget how the actors look...just listen to the music!)

The lyrics in Tamizh:

Rough translation:

Woman:

I found a new experience in him:
Wicked thoughts that didn't exist in earlier days.
My cheeks are rough with  the touch of a golden hand...

Man:

She came with unsteady, dancing steps
I went to her without telling anyone
She said that it shouldn't be...my heart can't bear it
I gave her one myself...she said it wasn't enough

Woman:

He came, saying, what eyes these are
I told him stories, saying, what a woman I am
I said, this is not enough; he said, now we shouldn't
I said, the rest of it; that's tomorrow, he said....

Man:

Her appearance, like a decorated temple chariot
My thoughts, embracing her saree and pallu
She said, where? I stood here
She came there...we went  somewhere....

Woman:

It was cool like snow, it was sweet like fruit
It fell like rain, and flowered as a blossom
There's no sleep, no unrequited longing
Until others see, there's no separation for us....


This was, I think, at the high point of Tamizh film music, when the greats gave us wonderful music.....
