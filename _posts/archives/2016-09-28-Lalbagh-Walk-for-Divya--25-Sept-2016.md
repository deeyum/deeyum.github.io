I was requested by Irina Ghose and Gopal to conduct a nature/birding walk at Lalbagh for their daughter Divya, who was celebrating her birthday.

I reached there early:

And got in some early-morning images:

This vendor of wheat-grass juice has his own power supply!

We gathered most of the group together for a "landmark" shot:

And off we went.


We started with the commonest of birds, the Blue Rock Pigeon:

and the Black Kite (here, a silhouette in the sky):

At the lake, we saw a Little Egret and a Purple Heron:

A Purple Swamphen:

A Common Moorhen:

A White-throated Kingfisher looked out over the rose garden.

The Spotted Owlets didn't seem too enthused to see me back again with another group:

It was very nice to see several of the children jotting down the birds' names:

The birds were not the only beautiful things around!

Some of the historic structures in the park also seemed lost in green dreams of long ago:

In the middle of the cultivated gardens I did find some tiny, exquisite wildflowers.

Here's everyone at the end of the walk, they seemed to have had a good time!

Divya cut her birthday cake, which attracted a few more children.

I left the children and the adults celebrating in the park, one of the jewels of our city
