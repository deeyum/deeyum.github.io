I went off by myself for an evening walk, and though the Great Horned Owls flew off too fast for me to get a picture, I did manage to get two raptors in the deepening dusk.

Here's the RED-TAILED HAWK:

...obviously calling to another one....

Here the hawk is, again in the act of preening itself...

I got a video of it, too:

On the way back home, in the gloaming, this KESTREL sat high up on a tree:

A closeup didn't work too well in the fading light:

But raptors are always beautiful, no matter what time of day it is!
