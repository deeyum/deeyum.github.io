I'd been on the

<a href="http://www.explorestlouis.com/myStl/memberDetails.asp?mID=1797&pt=1"> Planet Walk </a>

 a while ago, with the artist who put up the display on the Loop. Of course, since my middle name is Murphy, the telescope session after the astronomy talk was rained out...but I was lucky that the artist, Stephen Walker, did take me and an astronomy student on the walk, through the rain.

While at the astronomy talk, I learnt about 

<a href="http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/event-view.cfm?Event_ID=15170"> this event </a>

 which I will be attending tomorrow

I just hope rain doesn't play spoilsport again....so many events I've wanted to go to have been rained out! In any case, it's going to be great to see the Planetarium presentation, which won't depend on the weather.

The St.Louis planetarium doesn't have seats...one just lies down and watches the show!

Off to San Diego for the weekend.... this is going to be an LJ meet, because....that's where <LJ user="varshax"> and <LJ user="zweilinkefusse"> live with their son Achintya, and where <LJ user="enesrao"> is visiting them all... and since we are all LJ-ers (<LJ user="shortindiangirl">, <LJ user="chaibacca">, and <LJ user="biddli"> )it's going to be a great weekend, doing nothing much together!
