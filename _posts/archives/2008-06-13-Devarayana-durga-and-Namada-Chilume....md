On Sunday, <LJ user="adarshraju">,<LJ user="anushsh">,Geeta, Prasanna decided that we would make it a JLRNTP trip...Adarsh and I had thought of going to Bandipur or to Nagarhole, but then since there was a logistics problem, we decided on a closer destination instead. Devarayanadurga, about which I posted <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/368640.html"> here </a>, <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/370269.html"> here </a>, <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/369958.html"> here </a>, and <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/368232.html"> here </a> is still a fairly unspoilt and beautiful place, and that's where we went.


Let me start with one of the last images I photographed on the trip...it's that very beautiful bird, the BLACK-SHOULDERED KITE, in flight from the wire on which s/he was perched....

<lj-cut text="warning: LOTS of pictures, open only at leisure...here's our field trip">

Large mammals:


Here are the others...look at the two shutterbugs!

Anush and Adarsh with one camera seem OK:

But Geeta and Prasanna with one pair of binoculars were a little more funny!

Landscape:

Here's what the Devarayanadurga area looks like:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2878.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2878.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

And this is the scenery on the way to the Yoga Narasimhaswamy temple:

People and scenes:


We stopped at Dobbespet (must have been named for some Englishman named Dobbes, I guess, I am too lazy to google it up right now), and they have a cute little police station:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2816.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2816.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Almost in front of the police station, there was this "tinshack restaurant" where we had breakfast:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2817.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Not having eaten in this area before, I didn't know that they made idlis differently here. Instead of making small idlis, they pour the batter in a raised plate, and it makes a kind of thick pancake which is served with chatni, a little potato, and if liked, two masala vadas:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2821.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2821.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Update...apparently, this restaurant is pretty famous...and those are called "plate" idlis, what a lovely name!

These stainless steel tumblers made a pretty picture on the granite slab that served as the seat:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2819.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


And opposite us was this cute little girl who didn't want to share her father's tea and wanted a little tumblerful all by herself:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2824.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2824.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Mammals:


The only mammals we saw were the BONNET MACAQUES, but they were endlessly entertaining as usual...here's a sweet-looking baby, feeding on the leaves:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5658.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5658.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

I posted this photo on INW with the title, "Oh,God,he's started singing again!"

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5659.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5659.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Insects:

We saw a real variety of insects, though....

Here's a SPIDER WASP (POMPILINID) (Karthik, thanks for the id!)

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5670.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5670.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>



Here's one of the typical circular (do these ants use a compass or what?) ants' nests that I see so often in these areas; I have seen them in Bheemeshwari, too:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2836.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2836.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

We started our walk from Namada Chilume, and here's another procession of ants that crossed our path:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2841.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2841.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>



Here are two ladybird-like bugs mating..had to take the shot against the sky:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2845.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2845.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


And a Pierrot butterfly on a plant:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2846.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2846.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Sometimes the wildlife comes to us, instead of the other way around; here's a beautiful cat on Anush's jeans!

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2849.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2849.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

We saw what Geeta, Prasanna and I thought were two POTTER WASPS mating, but Adarsh insisted there was only one. I took a photograph (perhaps not of the exact same wasp?) and it appears to be only one...but I still don't know....


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5716-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5716-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Here's a COMMON CROW:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5680.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5680.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Some of the plants were covered by the nests of the SOCIAL SPIDERS:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5693.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5693.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

This <a href="http://wildwanderer.com/photography/photo.php?id=74&tag=Others"> BALL MILLIPEDE </a> I did not know about until I came back and asked Karthik for the id...click on its name to see how it rolls up into a ball on being disturbed!

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2838.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2838.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

And, as usual the Chilume (spring) area had a lot of RED-TAILED DRAGONFLIES sitting on the sheet rock:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2855.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2855.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

There were also these un-id dragonflies which were completely Communist:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5713.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5713.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Reptiles and amphibians:


We spotted a few of these FROGS in the Namade Chilume ponds:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2858.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2858.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

And then we also saw its predator, the GREEN KEELBACK:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2861.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2861.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

On seeing us, it quickly disappeared into the grass:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2865.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2865.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

We also saw a few ROCK AGAMAS:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5741.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5741.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Flora:

As we left, we snapped this beautiful water lily in the Namada Chilume pond:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2852.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2852.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>



This un id plant had leaves that were as beautiful as flowers!

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5674.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5674.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


This bamboo tree had started <a href="http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs050.htm">flowering </a>, which means that it will soon die...



<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5673.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5673.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Birds:

We did manage to see a few birds and raptors; here's a TAWNY EAGLE:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5683.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5683.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


Then, later, we saw this bird soaring overhead. The shape and the tail size made me feel it might be a BLACK EAGLE, but both Karthik and AMS feel that it is much more likely to be an ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5719-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5719-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


The SMALL MINIVETS didn't appear in large numbers, and it was possible only to get a bad shot of one:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5675.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5675.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


As we were returning, we saw a couple of EGYPTIAN VULTURES, here's a fuzzy shot of one:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5755.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5755.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

We all enjoyed watching this CRESTED SERPENT EAGLE watching us through the  leaves:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5642.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5642.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Two of them soared high above us and kept up their mewling call:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5729.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5729.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

As we returned, we saw the black-shouldred kite in hes habitat.<LJ user="sainath">, I must tell you that on the way back, I suddenly said, "Why have we not seen any black-shouldered kites so far? I want to see one!" and wham, within minutes, Prasanna spotted this bird! I think I am finding out how to do the "Sainath-wish"! 

The lovely bird:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5760.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5760.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

and perched so elegantly on the wire:

</lj-cut>

Let me close with this shot of two GREEN MARSH HAWKS (thanks for the id, Seshadri!) mating:
