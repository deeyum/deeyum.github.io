It was another enjoyable drive, with KM hogging the driving for the most part as usual. He is very creative about why I shouldn't drive..."You had a headache in the morning." "You may get a headache after driving." "The traffic is dense, so I'll drive." "The traffic is very light now so I can get the pleasure of driving." "The car is behaving well, so I'll enjoy driving." "The car is misbehaving, so I'd better drive."... and so it goes...I got to drive only for an hour, and the rest of the time, had to sit by:

But of course, on this trip, we all knew who was in the driver's seat!

<lj-cut text="scenes from the drive">


We started with the statue of the kaLari pAyattu swordsmen at Gemini circle:

I loved the saree display at Jyoti Fashions!

We passed our local Ferraris (don't believe me? Look at the door handles!)... don't miss the "Icee" salwar behind....

We passed the majestic windmill that, hopefully, cuts down the power bills by harnessing sustainable energy:

We had a <strike> piss </strike> pit-stop, and I spotted this Red-Wattled Lapwing in the distance:

D and I enjoyed snapping the Dragonflies as they perched on the tips of the twigs:

At Aryaas Hotel in Vellore, I enjoyed this beautiful kOlam:

The Vellore Fort ruins looked impressive...

And as we neared Krishnagiri, the rocky landscape dominated the skyline:

I also saw this swimming lady on the side of a bus, which reminded me that I need to get back to regular exercise....

We had some rain on the way, and it was wonderful to see this ice cloud forming:

Sunset brought us to Hosur, and so back home:

I also solved the mystery of the

...but that's the next post.

My KTB is home and the next 2 weeks are going to be devoted to her....while her mother takes an accelerated certification course, I can spoil her silly!
