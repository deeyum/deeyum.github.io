One of the worst parts of going for a walk in this country is the dreadful sight of other walkers...educated, "cultured", "refined" people...suddenly PEEling off from their walk into likely corners or sometimes just at the side of the road to....PEE. What is it in our ethos that makes it perfectly OK in our minds to spit, piss and defecate everywhere? 

I wonder how they would feel if I suddenly tapped them on their shoulder and scolded them...would this cure them of this disgusting habit? Sigh...I don't think so....they would just look over their shoulder and continue their "the whole place is my toilet" attitude....

If women (perforce) can control their bladders while walking, why can't men do so too?
