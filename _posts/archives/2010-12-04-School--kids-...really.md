When we took the Hosur schoolchildren on a nature trail (you can't go at 10.45 am and call it a birding trail!), I looked across the hills and saw this...

I told the children that the shepherd had also brought the Hosur school"kids" on a nature trail, and that they were probably busy watching US!


I do like that line of sure-footed goats along the rock, silhouetted against the overcast sky.
