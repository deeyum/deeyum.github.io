Raindrops themselves can be inverted image-makers of the world, instead of blotting out the world in a sheet of rain...

I loved the rain in Kodai, and the mists and clouds that it brought, as much as the sunshine:

The mist on the lake takes the images back to the sepia era of shadows, not colours.



There was an "almost rainbow" that formed in the rain-bearing clouds while I was walking around the golf course (with MLC of course) on the Kodai golf course.

Water and sunlight..together, they produce magic...and life.
