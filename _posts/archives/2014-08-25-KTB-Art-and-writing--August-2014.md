Boodi Ma's writing and art are progressing very well, now that she's started kindergarten.

Here's the cover illustration of a book I read to her (she read out many of the words, too):

Here's her first version of the picture:

Here's something she made for the Art Gala at her daycare (no, we didn't buy it!)

She wrote, and drew, her left hand:

She didn't display her tummy though she wrote it:

Developing fine motor skills make us happy, and grateful....
