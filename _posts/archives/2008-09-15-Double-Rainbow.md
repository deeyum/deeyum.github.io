You're feeling down and out.You feel old.
There's a storm about.You feel cold.
The storm clouds mass;the showers come to pass.
Suddenly, in the shrouds of grey rainclouds--
A rainbow in the sky! No...there are two!
Science can tell you why....but who
Wants to know why? Do you?
A rainbow is like life:
Full of both happiness and strife.
When there is  both sun and rain,
Both happiness and pain,
There is no black and white--
Only the prism show
Of the rainbow.
When the rain is stronger, and the sun,
The rainbow comes along with another one:
A little dimmer, not as bright.
A wonderful sight.
Pain and happiness together
Bring the rainbow of Life's weather.
Make the colours, seven-hued,
That lift the heart when they are viewed.
All I know
Is that I am lucky that my day...has  a rainbow.
