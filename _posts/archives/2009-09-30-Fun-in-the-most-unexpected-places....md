I look around...I can walk many a mile,
I find I'm never bored;
Not in sunshine, not in rain,
I can find beauty in a drain.

I just felt I had to smile
A look at this switchboard...
I really liked that humorous touch,
That, without talking, says so much.

Even something that is for just a while,
Something I cannot hoard:
A happy touch by my daughter
Seems to make honey of plain water!
