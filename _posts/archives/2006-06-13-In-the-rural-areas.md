Yesterday,we visited a friend's new farmhouse, just beyond Sarjapura. It has been built on a piece of land leading to a small lake, with ducks (mallards, I think) on it. The house was sparingly, but appealingly, furnished, with a strong breeze blowing through...on the terrace, my friend's wife had placed park-type seats and sitting there, watching a brahminy kite soaring and then dropping elegantly to perch on a wooden pole, feeling the breeze across my face, and watching the sunlight glitter on the water...I hardly knew how much time I had spent just sitting there when my friend came up to me and asked where I had been all this while. A piece of perfect peace...heaven comes in little slices, unexpectedly.
