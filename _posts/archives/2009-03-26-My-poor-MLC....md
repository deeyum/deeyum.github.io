Mr Thomas finally said he couldn't get spares for my wonderful MLC, the Canon S3 IS...so I am off to the Canon Service Centre on Brigade Road, to see if THEY can get whatever part it is that needs to be replaced....

Things have been VERY hectic lately....but we did find the time to go and see the annual visit of the glow-worms...

There were just four of them that day...haven't been able to go again! :(
