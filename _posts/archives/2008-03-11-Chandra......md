The moon
Sets so soon
Over my city....
Perhaps she waxes and wanes
From the energy she loses and gains
She looks lovely at the full...
When she draws up tides with her pull...
So thin she looks now...a pity
That she can't always be a full moon.
But we don't have the boon
Of making the most of ourselves, and being the best.
We wax and wane, too....sometimes being more, sometimes less.
