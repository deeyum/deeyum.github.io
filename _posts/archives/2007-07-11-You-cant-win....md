I was standing, waiting for some xerox copies to get done, when this little fellow stepped into a pile of sand and construction material. "Look," his mother scolded, "your rubber slippers are all dirty now!" So he sat down, took his slippers off, and carefully started rubbing their undersides with his little hands!

Poor little boy, he was so puzzled, because all he got for his pains was yet another scolding as he was dragged off..but I really wanted to hug him!
