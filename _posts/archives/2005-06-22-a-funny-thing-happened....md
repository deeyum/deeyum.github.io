we went and met our friends at Woody's, restaurant near here; since it was raining, we took the Wagon R,and by coincidence, both of us took a key each.When we came out after dinner, I couldn't find my key..and we had to come home and I was feeling bad that I had lost it. The next day, my friend came over for something and took out "her" car key to go out..and I told her it was mine. Her response was that I was obsessed with my car key and all remote keys made me think they were mine!It took 20 minutes of 
argument for me to convince her that she had remote locking on her Indigo and this was a Maruti key. But she was totally silenced when, at my suggestion, she fished in her handbag...and brought out her key as well! As soon as I had put it down on the restaurant table to eat my food the good housewife had automatically put the key into her handbag!If she had not come home the next day, AND if she had not taken out the car key in front of me instead of in the basement parking lot, I would have gone and made a new key and remote at a fairly high and unnecessary expense....
