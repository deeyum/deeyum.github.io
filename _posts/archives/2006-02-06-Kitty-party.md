I am not sure why I am not comfortable with kitty parties. Because of my frequent travelling, I am not a part of our building kitty;so today I decided that I would at least attend this one. There were no cards,and it was a pleasant afternoon, with a simple anagram game and housie. But once I get to know these women on a one-to-one basis, I don't think I would be interested in being part of the scene....there is some sense of disconnect somewhere that I cannot put my finger on...I wonder..what is wrong with me? Why does the whole housewife scene not satisfy me, given that I am not a career person? The only reason I can quantify is the occasional cattiness I see when women with time on their hands congregate...and their tendency to take their self-worth from their husbands' jobs and bank balances. Which reminds me of the cry from an elderly lady who lost her husband recently after 65 years of marriage..."who will respect me now?" In vain did I try to make her understand that she was herself as much as she was when her husband was alive, and that people would continue to respect her as before. Any thoughts on this, readers of my LJ?
