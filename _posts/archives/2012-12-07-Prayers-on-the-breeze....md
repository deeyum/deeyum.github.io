In Bhutan, anything....a human hand, the water in the mountain streams, the sunlight, the breeze...can be used to "power" a prayer. Surely this establishes that prayer is an energy, a force....?

Here are prayer flags, fluttering in the mountain breeze, atop the Bhutanese slopes.

One does feel closer to God in the mountains of Bhutan, where their majesty and scale humble the human ego and make us bow to the All-Pervading Spirit...
