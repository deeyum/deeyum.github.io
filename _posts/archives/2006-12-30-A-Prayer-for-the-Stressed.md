From an email from a friend of mine....


A PRAYER FOR THE STRESSED

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,the courage to
change things that I cannot accept,and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those
I had to kill today because they got on my nerves...

Also help me to be careful of the toes I step on today as they may be
connected to the feet I have to kiss tomorrow..

Help me to always give 100% at work..
12% on Mondays
23% on Tuesdays
40% on Wednesdays
20% on Thursdays
5% on Fridays

And help me to remember when I am having a bad day and it seems people are
trying to wind me up that..
It takes 42 muscles to frown, 28 muscles to smile, and only 4 to extend my arm
and smack someone in the mouth....
