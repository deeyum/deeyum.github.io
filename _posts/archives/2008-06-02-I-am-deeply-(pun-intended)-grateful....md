KM and I have no immediate family in India, apart from a dearly beloved brother and sis in law who live in Chennai. So friends are a very important part of our life.

I was touched to receive SO many good wishes from everyone today....and on both LJ, and elsewhere, I am sooooo *wipes a small tear away and tells herself not to be sloppily senti* happy about having such a group of good friends.

The world is a good place and I am lucky to be in a position where it seems so almost all the time.

Thank you, each and every person who wished us today. Thank you.For once, the words are not coming out in their usual torrential flow.....er...thank you.
