This was posted by Mr K U Varghese of Mysore,about whom I wrote in  <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/439026.html"> this post </a>, and  who repairs cameras....most of us just aim and shoot and have no idea of the complex and precisely engineered parts that go to make up our camera. This was an education for me, and I want to keep the reference to this image handy!

Update on 6 Oct....Here's another image from Mr Varghese:
