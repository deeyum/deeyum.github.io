It was great to meet up with <LJ user="dearchichi"> and <LJ user="shivakumar_l"> at Lalbagh, along with <LJ user="anushsh"> and <a href="http://fotodreamz.blogspot.com/"> Mahesh </a>...but we didn't spend too much time exchanging personal notes as we walked around the area, I got involved in some very nice macro stuff (one of which was my last post) and then when we all spotted <LJ user="sainath">'s SPOTTED OWLETS, the time just flew by and I had to rush off!

But hopefully, there will be more trips for wildlife and birding...and I *will* learn something more...!

Today, <LJ user="amoghavarsha">, <LJ user="anushsh">,<LJ user="dearchichi">, and <LJ user="deponti"> are doing an LJ wildlife trip...will post about what we saw,later...


Meanwhile, here's one more macro shot:
