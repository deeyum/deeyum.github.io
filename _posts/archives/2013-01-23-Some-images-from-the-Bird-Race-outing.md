It was great not to be in any kind of competitive mode, but to take a lot of people (and children) around, to show them as many birds as possible.

It started with sunrise (each day generally does!)

Here's our group....5 teams...25 people....

It was delightful to watch a flock of

ROSY PASTORS

land on the Palash tree to feast on the flowers.

The "Zoo Parking Lot 

RUFOUS-TAILED LARKS"

did not disappoint us!

A

WHITE-BELLIED DRONGO

was apparently a lifer for many in the group.

I liked the morning light on this

LITTLE CORMORANT

at the Kingfisher pond.

Here's team Black Stork, receiving the prizes, that we later gave to a Green Team, because they deserved it more than we did:
