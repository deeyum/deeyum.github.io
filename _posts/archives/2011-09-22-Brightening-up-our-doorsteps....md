I love rangOli and kOlam, the traditional art of door and floor decoration. Is it art? culture? tradition? hospitality?

...All of the above, I feel!


Here is a rangoli in front of the home of my friend, Alamelu Ramaswamy:

The colours and the warmth invite the passerby in....

The festivals of Navarathri and Deepavali are approaching, and I'll see a variety of patterns adorning everyone's doorstep....soon!
