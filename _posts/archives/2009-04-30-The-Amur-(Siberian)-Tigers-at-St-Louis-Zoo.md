Since the hospital was not ready to take in A as rooms were not free, I went off (with KM) to Forest Park for a long walk, and to see the five (yes, five!) Siberian tiger cubs that celebrated their first birthday yesterday. The big cat breeding program has been very successful in St Louis Zoo; I have already written about their success at breeding cheetahs. 

Well, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Tiger"> Siberian or Amur Tiger </a> is a critically endangered animal, and the Zoo has successfully been able to breed five cubs! And a birthday (whether of my GD or of Amur Tigers) is no small affair, so it was lovely to be able to see them....

Here's the sign about the Amur Tigers' birthday:

The tigers are nearly the size of their mother! But their baby fat and their mischief identifies them.

How playful children are, no matter where and what they are!
