This one was in the Hindu Temple of St Louis:

I was very tickled because a) the temple seems to have such a list of do's and dont's ... and the assumption seems to be that the reader IS wearing shorts!

And this one was in a Starbucks Cafe:

Nothing is simple any more. Everything is earth-friendly or supporting left-handed dyslexic abandoned abused minority women or something like that....but...what on EARTH is 10% post-consumer fiber and 60% post-conumer fiber??? Sounds so impressive...but what does it mean? And after all that "We are committed to..." stuff, is that line, "intended for single use..."!
