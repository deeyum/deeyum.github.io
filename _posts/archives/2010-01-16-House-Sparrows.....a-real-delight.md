This morning, I went to Ragihalli with Shashi and Shalini, my NTP friends ....and we watched this delightful episode....

Karthik tells me that these birds don't recognize themselves, and they think of the reflections as intruders; the female, he says, is often much more agitated than the male. But why they decided to perch on that difficult bit of window-pane and try and  why that female tries to get into the space between the wing-mirror and the glass...I still don't know!

Off to paati-cipate in the Bird Race tomorrow...and then a trip to Chennai....
