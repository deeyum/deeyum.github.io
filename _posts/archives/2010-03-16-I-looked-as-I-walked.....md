And as I looked, I found some of the signs of Spring..most notably, on a crack of the pavement (sorry, sidewalk!), I found this dandelion blooming:

This beautiful statue of Terra Madonna is near the Washington U Danforth Campus:

I took a close-up shot of the moss under the trees, and the little flowers are SO beautiful!

For <LJ user="beast_666">, I took this number plate:

(yes, I've seen no.s 1 and 2, too!)


One of the other things in the sky, apart from the birds, was this lovely little single-propeller plane:

And as I walked home I saw a spider, well, that's actually a Spiderman...here he is, quite literally hanging out, from one of the apartments at Delmar!

A walk is such fun, and one sees such random stuff :)
