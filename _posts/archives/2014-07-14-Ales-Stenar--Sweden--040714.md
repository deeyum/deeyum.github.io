"Ale's Stones (or Ales stenar in Swedish) is a megalithic monument in Sk√•ne in southern Sweden. It is a stone ship, oval in outline, with the stones at each end markedly larger than the rest. It is 67-metres long formed by 59 large boulders, weighing up to 1.8 tonnes each," says the Wiki.

We took the road from Tomelilla to Ystad:

We passed some beautiful buildings on the way:

<lj-cut text="many photos, see only if so inclined" ....="....">

It was wonderful to see so many cycles!

One cyclist reminded me of me!

We went through fields of poppies:

and potatoes:

We entered Kaseberga:

I'd made a packed lunch, and we sat and ate it with relish!

(That dahi is TEN PERCENT FAT!!!)

Both the cultivars and the wildflowers, like this Swedish Jasmine (or perhaps it is Mockorange?) were beautiful!

This Hollyhock was nearly black!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14624569213" title="IMG_2661 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3875/14624569213_89505f49f5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2661"></a>

Nina id'd the Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), which can be medicinal or toxic to humans, depending on its use:

Bluebells nodded in the breeze:

Poppies laughed in the wind:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14604558935" title="IMG_2677 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3905/14604558935_e4bcc95ff5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2677"></a>


They were beautiful, whether or not I knew their names!

Imagine having rambler roses growing wild!

The souvenir shop was very colourful:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14418098777" title="IMG_2660 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3868/14418098777_770ed9b5ef_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2660"></a>

Some gates were obviously not used!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14603950182" title="IMG_2670 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3919/14603950182_7887b7455b_z.jpg" width="640" height="472" alt="IMG_2670"></a>

Some wall decorations were lovely:

We walked past this ancient cottage, dreaming in the sunshine.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14603996722" title="IMG_2693 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2898/14603996722_bdfed4c818_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2693"></a>

Who's more beautiful...Nina or the poppies?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14417964250" title="IMG_2705 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3850/14417964250_df05d41345_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2705"></a>

Fat, woolly sheep were grazing everywhere:

We approached the stone "ship":

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14620251322" title="IMG_2713 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14620251322_44d6d8b5df_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2713"></a>

We found some paragliding attempts in progress, but there was not a stiff enough breeze.

We sighted the Baltic Sea:

the cove had a sandy beach:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14640709943" title="IMG_2745 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2918/14640709943_7226584768_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2745"></a>

At last we were near Ales Stenar:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14620258362" title="IMG_2751 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14620258362_c6b6c9c996_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2751"></a>

But you think I'm going to let you see it? I'd got sidetracked by some beautiful butterflies in the grass:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14618692794" title="IMG_2756 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3893/14618692794_def493bc38_z.jpg" width="640" height="401" alt="IMG_2756"></a>

The sea called everyone:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14434387647" title="IMG_2779 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/14434387647_d69bdcfaf7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2779"></a>

Ok, ok! Here is the stone ship, from prehistoric times...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14618696324" title="IMG_2781 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2898/14618696324_c9e2c2900e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2781"></a>

I was again sidetracked by many larks, that went up in the air to sing:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14620263032" title="IMG_2782 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2923/14620263032_4bcf91510c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2782"></a>

They landed again (I had to keep far from them!)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14640718383" title="IMG_2788 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/14640718383_cf8ba4d658_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2788"></a>

Here's a short video of their behaviour:

Back to the awe-inspiring Ales Stenar!

Amongst the ancient stones, a traditional pastime, kite-flying, was being tried out:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14618700324" title="IMG_2814 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3872/14618700324_d599a7f80b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2814"></a>

The grasses and the sea made a stunning combination!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14620274642" title="IMG_2830 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5233/14620274642_56374e9462_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2830"></a>

So did the wildflowers and the sky:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14640728583" title="IMG_2832 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14640728583_76545f80d1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2832"></a>

A puff of wind would play parent...

The product of this seed would set me dreaming in a different way :D

Houses talked about the past, too:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14434407077" title="IMG_2852 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2906/14434407077_e36a6fa2f5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2852"></a>

Windows were works of art:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14620279652" title="IMG_2844 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14620279652_ea0fbb39d2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2844"></a>

Treasures lay spilled:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14434406157" title="IMG_2847 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3894/14434406157_7e58258454_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2847"></a>

</lj-cut>

Some houses were mute; it was their thatched roofs that harked back to ancient times, and it was as if an eye was open in that roof:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14434407337" title="IMG_2853 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2908/14434407337_d38cdd36bb_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2853"></a>

Some of the houses were pretty old, too, if not pre-historic!
