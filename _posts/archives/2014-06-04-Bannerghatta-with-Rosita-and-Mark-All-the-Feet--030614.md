Rosita called and invite me to go with her and Mark to his yoga teacher, Rama's farmhouse in Bannerghatta, and I immediately said yes.

It was a quick visit, but it was so pleasant and enjoyable. The farmhouse is situated right behind that of Fred and Clare Pais..and I had a wonderful time looking at two feet (and a huge beak) (Loten's Sunbird)

Six very tiny feet with a very business-like sting:

Two feet that have difficulty, yet go everywhere:
