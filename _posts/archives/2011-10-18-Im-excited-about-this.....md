About the Puttenahalli Lake: Two years ago, the lake which covers an area of about 13 acres was on the brink of extinction. Now it is home to several species of water and land birds, butterflies and many insects. Over 200 trees have been planted around the periphery of the lake which teems with fish, crabs, water snakes, etc. In short, the lake is natural world in a microcosm, a sanctuary in the middle of a concrete urban jungle. 

About the Guide: Ms. Deepa Mohan is interested, among other things, in photography and wildlife, both forest and urban. She writes occasionally for Citizen Matters and is a member of the Bird Watchers' Field Club, of birding and nature enthusiasts in Bangalore. 

About PNLIT: The Puttehanalli Neighbourhood Lake Improvement Trust is a registered not-for-profit charitable organization which has been actively working with the BBMP to rejuvenate and maintain the Puttenahalli Lake. Ours is the first citizens' group to be formally assigned this responsibility. Read about PNLIT in: http://sites.google.com/site/puttenahallilakeonline/
