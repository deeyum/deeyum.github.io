YAYYY, I found the card reader, must begin the mammonth task of deleting lousy photographs now.

But two I really like:


Agumbe has the highest rainfall in south India, and mists,rain, and a hide-and-seek sun are usual.


Here's the sunrise on the day we arrived:

I love the "fingers of God"....


Ooh, I have got the S3 pics on the camera.... the pictures may be erratic, but there has been so much of learning, hopefully it will sink into the concrete cauliflower and not sink without trace...! :)
