Got that lovely song, "VaseegarA", on YouTube....

<lj-embed id="40"/>


Well, that's Jayalalitha (sorry, add another 'a' at the end!) with some boon companion (no, it isn't Sasikala! )....does it, or does it not, look like a gay/lesbian rights song? I have forgotten what the original song was...can someone tell me?

The words of this song are somehow better in Hindi than in Tamizh, where they seem a little awkward...."oru pOrvakkuL iru thookkam" sounds not at all poetic!


vaseegara...en nenjinikka...un ponmadiyil thoonginAl pOthum...

O, one who attracts me...to sweeten my heart, all I need is to sleep in your golden lap...
At the same time, all the yearnings of my earlier sleepless births will cease...
I love, I breathe, because of your kindness....I yearn, I stagnate,in memories of you...


Heavy rains will come, we'll get drenched; love and drying out in the cold...two sleeping in one blanket...

You tell me cool lies, but even knowing that, that's what my mind expects...

No need to go out, just at home, every day, I want you...

Sometimes, in play, I want me in your clothes.... vaseegara....


Every day, when you finish your bath, you dry your hair with a corner of my saree..that's poetry!

Like a thief, you skulk and put your arms around me from behind, suddenly...that's poetry!

If someone asks the time, I don't even know to say it...

In the eternity of love, there is no time measure by clocks...vaseegara....


I *still* can't translate it properly, and I *still* like the Hindi version better...
