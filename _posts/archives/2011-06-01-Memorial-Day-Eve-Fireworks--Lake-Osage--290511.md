We watched a lovely firework display as part of the Memorial Day eve celebrations at Lake Ossage:

They were lovely, but the most stunning fireworks I've ever seen (and I've seen them in Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai, New York, Singapore, and Dubai!) were at the Pooram Festival in Kerala...it was nearly three hours of incredible fireworks, one extremely hot and humid May 1, sometime in the early nineties....
