Can anyone (especially the many folks I know at Yahoo) tell me why, on Flickr, the Medium size of a picture is the same pixel size as the Large? And why have two "sizes" at all, when they are the same? (They used not to be, earlier. The Large size was inconvenient for LJ as it would often overrun page width.)
