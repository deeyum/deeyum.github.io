I'd gone with Girish and <lj user="birdonthewire"> for the 3rd Sunday bngbirds outing, this time from the Ramakrishna Ashram, Shivanahalli, on into the Bannerghatta forest area. The highlight for me, was Harsha spotting this wonderful

...a tiny plant that's insectivorous!

If you look carefully, you can see the insects that have fallen into the "dew trap"!
