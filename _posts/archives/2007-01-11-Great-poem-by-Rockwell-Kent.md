Poem by Rockwell Kent
Dear Sir, You ask me how to buy
Great art for your collection.
You'll pardon me, therefore, if I
Am frank in this connection.
First, then, avoid the purchase of
Whatever gives you pleasure,
For probably the things you love
Are bad beyond all measure.
Beware the dealer's guiding hand
And grasp it with misgiving;
He knows that you know nothing, and
That's how he makes his living.
All studio receptions shun
And Greenwich Village dances
And when you meet an artist, run
Like mad from his advances.
Mistrust all articles on Art
And critic's expositions;
From dilettantes stay apart,
And shy at exhibitions.
In fact, one single rule I know
Which possibly may aid you,
And that is simply this; lay low
And trust in God who made you.
And when you're sure a thing's *not* great
And know that you don't  like it,
Buy it at once; don't hesitate;
And ten to one, you'll strike it.

Rockwell Kent
