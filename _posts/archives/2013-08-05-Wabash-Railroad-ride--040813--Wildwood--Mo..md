We heard about the

The 

<a href="http://www.wfprr.com/"> Wabash Railroad </a>

and decided that we'd go for the ride on Sunday.

We found that it was a tiny railroad, with engines built to scale:

Here's a video of a train leaving:

DS cycled up and back, a matter of about 60 miles!  This left a seat free in the car for our friend Karthik O. 

Here's the family:

Here's the yard:

This notice on the water tower was hilarious..."not for human consumption"...but apparently, the trainmaster is not considered human!

We went chugging past the limestone bluffs of the area:

The tracks crisscrossed many walking and cycling trails. I loved this tandem bike with a provision for a young child!

Here's another locomotive, built to scale:

There were lots of volunteers to man the railroad, here's one being the guardsman:

We were thrilled that the train ran through Mohan, Missouri!

A filming crew was at work, and our train ride took a long time as we were held up.

 Mother and daughter whiled away the time:

Here's the video!

It's not a loop, so the train had to go to the end point, have the engine de-coupled and reconnected, and then we were brought back:

The woodland was lovely:

At the departure point, engines use the turntable:
