The dreams, the imagination, the fantasy...children live in a world in their minds,that adults can only rarely enter.The story-teller is one person who can bridge that gap...the person who actually can take them to those places in their minds where other worlds exist. How can there be any childhood without stories to feed a child's heart, mind and soul?

I took this at KTB's daycare, Urban Sprouts. I went to pick her up, but she would not come home with me until the story was finished!
