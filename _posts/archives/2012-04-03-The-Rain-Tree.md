Why is it called "Rain"
When it flowers in the hot sun?
By the time the monsoon arrives
The flowering is done.

Perhaps the tree is called so
Because it rains so much on us....
Shade, shelter to creatures, clean air;
Beauty and grace.. in silence, without any fuss.

Off to Gir, to see the Asiatic Lions (never been there)...back in a week :)
