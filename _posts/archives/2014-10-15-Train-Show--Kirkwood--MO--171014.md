We'd already had a marathon Lego session in the morning:

We decided to visit tht

(my goodness, they are already talking about 2015!)

in the afternoon.

My father collected 

<a href="http://www.tri-ang.co.uk/"> Tri-ang Model Railways </a>

pieces for more than twenty years, and the collection was carefully maintained by my brother after my father's death. We had quite a huge setup, and I must say, with the Indian dust, it was quite a pain to maintain 

It was a riot of colour, scale, and detail.

My favourite was the road roller that had flattened one of the workers. Another laconic worker stands ready to scrape the single-dimension friend off the roller, and two others wait with the stretcher:

Here's a beautiful gradient bridge

There was a tiny pumpkin chugging around in this Halloween diorama:

Thomas the Tank Engine is one of KTB's favourites:

For all the detail, though, I looked in vain for the kind of sets my father had collected, eg, a mail train that would whip off the tiny post bags at one station and drop them off in a container on the other side. 

I must say, the average age of the people who had the collections can be described thus: "When there was any hair, it was white."

There were, however, times when some of us were less than interested:

Here's our little paper-hat engineer:

And the other one!

Alas, the sale area was completely given up to serious scale-model fans. If they'd just had one ordinary train set, their sales would, I feel, have gone much better!

I've put up more photos on

Here are two videos that I took:

Even the cars in the parking lot had appropriate number plates!

It was an enjoyable show that brought back many memories.
