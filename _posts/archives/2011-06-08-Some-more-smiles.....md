Each of these made me smile.

First off, I do know that tables have feet, but....

Either DS was drying his shoes, or he was really telling that table to take a hike....

I spotted this lovely sticker in (of course) Forest Park:

What made me smile was that it was right next to car with a bumper sticker that said "I hate people who put bumper stickers on their cars"!


At the Zoo, I thought it was very apt for a water fountain to  be donated by the...Sippy family!

The fact remains, of course, that one cannot be sipp(y)ing water from a fountain.


I think I may have posted this sign before, but I still find it amazing that in true capitalism, Joe can actually make money by selling his clothes. I wonder if anyone wants many of mine?

And of course, this number plate could only exist in the US of Eh!
