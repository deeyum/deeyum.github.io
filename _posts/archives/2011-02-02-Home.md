Feels good...but so many things have to be repaired...broken airbag, broken suitcase, broken laptop and (hopefully not broken) ankle...will have to figure a way to take the pics off KM's laptop and post them...I am so happy with the trip...but it's already receding into the distance as I get ready for the arrival of my brother in law, of <LJ user="idahoswede"> and <LJ user="kejn">, <LJ user="shortindiangirl">, <LJ user="biddli"> ...several weddings coming up, some of which we can attend, some not...difficult to choose!

Wonder if I will have time to ever catch up on LJ friends' entries...
