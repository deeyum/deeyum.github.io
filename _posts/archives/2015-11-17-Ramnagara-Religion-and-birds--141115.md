It was a cloudy, misty day, but enough friends were enthusiastic about a birding/nature trip.

We went to Kanva Reservoir, actually, and saw some bright colours in spite of the gloom:

But the weather being cloudy and dull, I decided to take the group to Ramadevara Betta Vulture Sanctuary, and we were privileged to see a Long-billed Vulture mother on her nest!

After visiting Kanva, I decided that Prayut and Aishwary, who have moved to Bangalore recently from Jabalpur, should also try for the Yellow-throated Bulbul, so we went back and climbed the hill. Sure enough, they got their bird!

and a bonus, the male Asian Paradise Flycatcher, flaunting his delectable tail around:

I took these snaps of the Ramadevara temple at the summit of the hillock:

Just when one's knees complained, there was this heartening message!

And across the slopes, on the cactus, sat this beautiful Blue Rock Thrush.

Birds...the natural beauty of the place...these are MY religion, and my temple is the entire area I surveyed. But different strokes for different folks! Some need the stripes that mark a temple:

And some, like me, are happy to look around, breathe in the fresh air, and enjoy themselves...here we all are, doing just that!
