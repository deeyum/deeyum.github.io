If there are one or more people on your friends list who make your world a better place just because they exist, and who you would not have met (in real life or not) without the Internet, then post this same sentence in your journal.

I found this on <LJ user="premkudva">'s LJ and he found it on <LJ user="idahoswede">'s LJ...both of them qualify for that statement above!

OK, when YOU read this....
