Here's <LJ user="rohan_kini">'s entry about an initiative by two young men to publicize the merits of cycling, and the dangers of global warming:

I was typing out my comment to him, when I decided that I would make a post of it:

Well, Rohan, I am not belittling the effort of these young men, but I do take issue with your assumption that only if you do something oriented towards publicity are you doing your bit. What about the rest of us, who walk and cycle wherever we can, who take our own bags to the market, who make sure our neighbours don't litter? I do feel that PR seems to be the name of the game...you must do even good things in a "cool" way in order to be praiseworthy!

Not all of us stop at cribbing, you know. Many of us try to do whatever we can; but few of us are articulate or vocal about it...especially since we feel we are in a small minority.

When I had started cycling, (I don't cycle for weekend trips, but do so  for all my daily work, instead of taking the car), I phoned up the number that had been given in the newspaper about a cycling initiative (which Bob Hoekstra had joined). I was told I was too old for the campaign, and that they wanted only "well-known" people, for weekend cycling. Humph!

What I appreciate about people like  you, Rohan, is that you cycle DAILY to work, and also do your weekend leisure activities without polluting the environment.

Yes, many of us in the city may be apathetic.

But- don't dismiss the rest of us with one line--"But have not seen anyone do anything about this" --just like that!

And...I want you to keep in touch with these people ...two years later...are they still cycling? Are they still following the same precepts? That would be a sustained effort, after making a good start with the run/cycle trip. Sustained effort is as important as the first keen beginning...that's where many of us falter.

But perhaps I sound graceless..actually, I feel that there is so much to be done to change people's mindsets that each and every initiative like this is just great. My best wishes to the duo, I hope their effort is successful.
