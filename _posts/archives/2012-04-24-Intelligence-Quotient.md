I was asked what my IQ was and I replied that the IQ test I had taken was, to my mind, not a test applicable to all human beings, it needed a certain kind of culture and upbringing, and so I could not hold such a test as valid. I also intuitively felt that intelligence is of different kinds.

Having said all this, I was then asked point blank what my IQ was rated as. On hearing my answer, the reply was, "But that's great! Why do you want to say all this about IQ tests, then?"

Intelligence, that has not been leavened by wisdom, maturity and humility, is like the raw clay which can either be fashioned into a better human being...or a figure of raw clay.
