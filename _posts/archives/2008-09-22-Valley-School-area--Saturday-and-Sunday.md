What a lovely weekend....I got to go to the Valley School area on both Saturday (with Bharat, <a href="http://pratima-jayaram.blogspot.com/2008/09/review-wednesday.html"> Pratima </a> , Vijay etc) and on Sunday (<a href="http://fotodreamz.blogspot.com/"> Mahesh Devarajan </a> and <LJ user="anushsh">)....and attended "Dhwani", the annual fundraiser of <a href="http://www.themedguru.com/directory/bangalore_kidney_foundation_bkf-111.html"> Bangalore Kidney Foundation </a>. Excellent concerts and birdsong, and on Sunday it was the birthday of Srikrishna, who works for <a href="http://www.unitus.com/"> Unitus </a>...and met <a href="http://www.truveo.com/Vikram-Sampath-Udaya-TV-Interview-Part-1/id/2874462581"> Vikram Sampath </a>, too....it was a hectic weekend but extremely enjoyable, with a good meeting for Clean and Green thrown in as well....when, in the middle of an urban park, we had an excellent sighting of a SHIKRA!

Humans singing and birds singing...what more could one want!

Let me start with some of the butterflies, bees and insects I saw over both days (after all, they have the most eye appeal!)

The JEZEBEL on a LANTANA  plant:

A WHITE-ORANGE TIP (yes, *some*times butterfly names make sense!)

A COMMON PIERROT....see how it is drinking from that drop of rainwater on the leaf, so delicate and beautiful!

We all say, "I need a drop of water to drink", but this butterfly really means it!



A GRASS YELLOW:

H S Ganesh, during his talk on Creative Wildlife Photography at the INW Mysore meet, talked of how most photographers had already got their "BOS" pictures..."birds on sticks"! So, just to be different, here's another type of BOS....Bug on Stick (no I don't know the id, hoping that Madhu will help out!)

I am not sure, but I think this was a type of CARPENTER BEE (open to correction please!) but it was lovely watching it going from wildflower to wildflower....

Here it is, slightly close, but the wings are beating so fast that they cannot be caught on camera:

I loved this arching grass over the bee....

Other creatures will follow, but we are moving our office space and I *H  A  T  E* moving, so I am off now....
