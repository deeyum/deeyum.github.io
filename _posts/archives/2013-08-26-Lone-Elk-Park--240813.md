...And here's the Lone Elk!

After spending a day at the 

<a href="http://www.purinafarms.com/"> Purina Farms Family Day </a>

a paid event to which we went (the pictures are

I asked if we could drive through

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/337762.html"> Lone Elk Park </a>

(click on the name above for the post of my first visit there)

<lj-cut text="all that we saw">

Click on the name of each animal, or bird, to get to the Wiki entry and info about it.

and so we did...we were not supposed to get out of the car, but it was a very productive "car safari".

This sign kept me in the car more effectively than tigers or lions could have done!

I'm still digging tick heads out of my skin after each foray into Forest Park, so I had no wish to do more excavation.

Here are the prairie grasses....

We started with some 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_box_turtle"> EASTERN BOX TURTLES </a>


sunning themselves on rocks in the water...

We then saw a

 doe:

Then we saw herd of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk"> ELK </a>:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9595244416/" title="DSC06624 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/9595244416_99502f1be7_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06624 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

Some of them had been ear-tagged (for safety and tracking, one assumes)

You can see the ear tag and the lovely liquid eye:

Others sat around in the grass, not bothered about the passing cars, in much the way our mammals do in Bandipur...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9595243682/" title="DSC06630 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3670/9595243682_3c40309ab7_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06630 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

In fact, some of them did not even raise their heads!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9592450597/" title="DSC06631 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3685/9592450597_6035e2500f_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06631 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

They were clearly telling us not to come back :)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9595243040/" title="DSC06633 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/9595243040_25be6ee300_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06633 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

Such beautiful animals!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9595242596/" title="DSC06635 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/9595242596_fef88fcd16_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06635 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

We then entered the Bison area, with repeated warnings not to get out of the car:

A group of


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_turkey"> WILD TURKEYS </a>

 delighted me.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9592448683/" title="DSC06643 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3735/9592448683_f47a0bc1c0_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06643 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

We were lucky to come upon a herd of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison"> AMERICAN BISON </a> :

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9592448399/" title="45 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7284/9592448399_a70f0811a5_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="45 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>

During the summer, with food plentifully available, they don't always come up near the road, so we were lucky! (Yes, I 've gone through the ride sometimes without sighting a single animal.)


I find it hilarious that the scientific name of the American Bison is Bison bison, and that of the the Plains Bison is...Bison bison bison!

Apart from the massive adults, there was a little calf, too:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9595240920/" title="DSC06646 240813 Lone Elk Park by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3686/9595240920_0482423d3a_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC06646 240813 Lone Elk Park"></a>


The

<a href="http://www.stlouisco.com/ParksandRecreation/ParkPages/LoneElk"> Lone Elk Park website </a>

says this little bull calf was born on Jan 3, 2013!


Why do young ones always look so adorable?

"Come along, come along!" the mother said....

They continued grazing.

The sheer size of these animals is awesome.

Here's a short video of the  American Bison:

We then went on, not really hoping for much more...but a marvellous surprise awaited us, as we saw the magnificient antlers of this

Elk Stag:

He wandered across the road:

On he went, slowly:

He stopped to have a good scratching session....

We left Lone Elk Park, very happy with what we'd seen in the short time we'd been there, particularly since I'd not expected to see anything at all in the lush foliage!
