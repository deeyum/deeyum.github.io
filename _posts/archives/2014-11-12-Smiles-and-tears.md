Usually, they work well together...
But,sometimes
The mind and the heart
Go their different ways.
The mind calmly accepts
That all is well, and that
Technology can keep me in touch.
But the heart
Pines, and longs, and yearns...
Reason crinkles the eyes in a smile;
Emotion squeezes tears out of them.
