I know squirrels are extremely common animals, and are sometimes regarded as pests, but they are so interesting to watch!

They watch you from the ground...

They watch you as they climb the tree quickly, to get out of your way...

They continue watching you carefully after they are in the tree (oh, I really loved photographing that beady little eye!)

But when they *think* you're not watching....they do have fun!

And..you want to know what traction is?

Here's <lj user="asakiyume">'s <a href="http://asakiyume.livejournal.com/287678.html"> post </a> about a squirrel and his tail...

I really wish I could write fantasy the way she, or <lj user="inspirethoughts">, do...but I guess I am a very factual and dry person; my fantasy life is very poor indeed!
