⁠⁠⁠From a friend.The last page of my notebook...

A place where I check 
whether my pen is working or not
A place where I calculate 
the percentage out of the marks I got

The last page of my notebook...

A place where I play the game 
of flames with my secret crush's name
Then strike it off so that no one sees
and not giving a chance for my best friend to tease

The last page of my notebook...

A place where I chat
with my friend when the class is going on
Unable to listen 
the boring lecture going on since morn

The last page of my notebook...

A place where I note 
important questions for the upcoming exam
A place where I scribble 
random things or even try drawing the funny face of Ma'am

The last page of my notebook...

A place where I write 
beautiful lines of my favorite song
A place where me and my friend play 
tic-tac-toe with marks of right and wrong

The last pages of our notebooks... 
aren't just pages, They are much more... 
They are precious diaries...
where I unknowingly treasure our teenage memories...
