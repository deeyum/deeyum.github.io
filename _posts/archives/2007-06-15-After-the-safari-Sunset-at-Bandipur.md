When the light sinks down to liquid gold
And the monsoon clouds reflect the sight;
When the birds and beasts return to their fold
And there approaches the dark of the night...

The barbed wire, the weeds, they keep the jungle out;
Within their encirclement sits Man...
But still beyond the barriers his mind roams all about
As he seeks to find the answers that he can.

The mind calms; the heart's content; now fails the light;
Sweet are the gentle joys at end of day;
Wonderstruck with all that was seen till night,
Homewards we wend our pleasantly weary way.

Wish I could share the peace of the evening a little better...words are lovely, but often inadequate.
