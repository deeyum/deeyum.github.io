I went for a nice walk this afternoon; it was getting cloudy and chilly, but it was LOVELY to walk along. I decided to take KM's Fuji Finepix and it's an amazing camera. 

Here's a "Homes and Gardens" photograph that I got:

And...the first common bird (I didn't take any photograph of the STARLING, remembering <LJ user="yathin">'s strictures)...my fellow BULBs, ladybirders and gen'mun...the AMERICAN ROBIN:

Not bad detail for a point-and-shoot, eh?

And for those of you who have never seen an American Robin teaching us about the Cycle of Life:

 More later...ohmigoodness, I better get some sleep....

TGB is probably only going to arrive when labour is scheduled to be induced, on 280409....looks like it's going to miss its other grandmom's birthday, which is also the birthday of <LJ user="yathin">....
