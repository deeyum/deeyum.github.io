Close friends picked up, packed me in their Tavera... a family of 5 who included me in their evening drive through the pouring rain, while we individually and together, sang favourite songs....rain is wonderful...IF you have a nice warm place to shelter in, your livelihood doesn't depend on the weather, and you are assured that you will have a hot meal when you feel hungry....how lucky we are.
