It was cloudy and the sun had just set when we came to Sunset Point. But...

There are times when the twilight scene soothes and calms the spirit; instead of thinking of it as a dying day, one thinks of it as a fitting conclusion to a happy day. Night becomes a time of repose and camaraderie that one looks forward to.

What is it about a few trees, the air and the colours that one star can produce here, that makes us go quiet in spite of ourselves, and softly puts serenity and peace in our hearts? Surely, a wonder and a miracle.
