Yes, yes, I know this is grainy, non-professional..and I was jostled about by KM and his brothers, all trying to take their images too...but still..when you see the line of animals stretching from one horizon to the other...it's amazing.

By the way...that panning is only from left to right, it is NOT all around me. It is an entire length (kilometres of it) of wildebeest, as far I could see and capture...

Will be posting more videos...beware!
