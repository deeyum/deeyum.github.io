On the advice of <LJ user="pondhopper">, I tried using CAPTCHA, and that seems to have brought out the spambots in a perfect frenzy. I am inundated with spam...I am at my wits' end about what to do. Repeated requests to the LJ admin hasn't worked, either. The day is not far off when I will have to leave LJ...what's the point of my going on posting stuff, and then deleting spam from my email inbox? I want to comment on others' posts, have conversations, debates and arguments...it' no fun standing on a wall and shouting into empty space!

At least I am able to *read* others' posts, that's a mercy...
