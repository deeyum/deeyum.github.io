KTB and her mother's flight arrived one and a half hours late, and we barely had a few hours of sleep...but this morning, she walked into our home and hearts again...


Here she is, showing her grandfather how to wear pink dolls on his glasses:

Now she's showing <lj user="itsalouwelylife"> how to do puja:

She was running a high fever, so finally she lay down and went to sleep..here's one delightful Biddlesfoot!

My laptop is having immense problems, and it's most unresponsive...so give me a little while to sort things out :( It's like working through a wall of sludge.
