Jeddy Narayan is a bear of somewhat ancient vintage; he's the only bear I know, who has moved from Europe to Asia to America.

This teddy bear  was given to a little girl, aka <lj user="shortindiangirl"> ,  by her uncle, who lugged him all the way from London, to India, for her. She was quite literally attached to it;  she called it, at first, "Teddy Narayan". She would never move without it, and from the time she put on a pair of her own panties for the bear...panties are called Jeddy in Tamizh...the bear changed his name to "Jeddy Narayan". JN actually went without a visa to the US, when the not-so-little-any-more girl went to study there...and now...keeps that little girl's little girl company! 

You can also see an octopus (rare sighting!) in the photo below:

As you can see, LG's LG (KTB) doesn't always treat the bear too well...but I think he can grin...and...bear it!
