I belong to an egroup, in which I am NOT an active participant. For the past month  I kept on finding messages like this one:


 
"I requested to remove my name from your mailing list. Plese (sic) do it.
Krishnan"

I saw even funnier messages, like:

"I am receiving un solicited mails from this address . It is offence to send un solicited mails . 
please take all action to stop this menace . 
If I receive one more mail I will be forced to take legal action . 
Please take this as a final notice "

(This is a music-club related egroup, for goodness' sake!)


So, purely in an altruistic spirit, I wrote an email to the egroup, suggesting the following...

"Anyone who wishes to have their email removed from the egroup just has to send an email to
 
nameofegroup-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com
 
and it will automatically get done, There is no need to keep requesting other people to do it.
 
DM."

Of course, I promptly got this message (addressed, of course, to the entire egroup!)

"Ms.DM,
 
Please remove my email from the group. Thanks.
 
Regards, Shankarans"

What on earth....??? And I thought *I* was totally internet un-savvy!

The internet has many sources of entertainment...
