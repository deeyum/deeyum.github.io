I went to photograph the Red-tailed Hawk nest that 

<a href="http://forestparkowls.blogspot.com">Mark Glenshaw </a>

 told me about, but forgot the location he had told me, so I went up to

<a href="http://citycyclingtours.com/index.html"> Chris Gerli </a>

and he helpfully marked the nest location on a map of Forest Park, and sent me on my way.

 
Though it was quite hot, I enjoyed the walk, and I located the nest high above in a deciduous tree near the Muny. Here's the scene:

The nest is to the left, and one of the parents is sitting on the tree to the right:

I walked as close as I dared (the tree is on a golf course, so there are people around all the time, but still...), and aimed my camera up to get both parents in the nest:

Then, to my delight, I spotted one of the nestlings:

And it peeped out at me!

Very happy with the sighting, I walked home in the humid heat...but Forest Park had a few more delights awaiting me yet! But for these Hawks...thank you, Mark and Chris! 

Here's Chris, in front of his cycle rental van:

Next up, the Western Painted Turtle, the Green Heron, and the Ruby-throated Hummingbird....
