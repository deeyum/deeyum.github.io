I was listening to the songs on a playlist sent to me by <lj user="itsalouwelylife"> and came, by various links, to this all-time favourite of mine:

Lyrics:



Jo Vaada Kiya Woh Nibhaana Padega
Roke Zamaana Chaahe Roke Khudaai
Tumko Aana Padega

Tarasti Nigaahon Ne Aawaz Di Hai
Mohabbat Ki Aahon Ne Awaaz Di Hai
Jaane Hayaa Jaane Ada Chodo Tarsaana
Tumko Aana Padega

Ye Maana Hamein Jaan Se Jaana Padega
Par Ye Samajh Lo Tumne Jab Bhi Pukaara
Humko Aana Padega...

Hum Apni Wafaa Pe Na Ilzaam Lenge
Tumhe Dil Diya Hai Tumhe Jaan Bhi Denge
Jab Ishq Ka Sauda Kiya, Phir Kya Ghabraana
Humko Aana Padega

Chamakte Hain Jab Tak Yeh Chaand Aur Taare
Na Tootenge Ab Keh Do Paimaan Hamaare
Ek Doosra Jab De Sadaa Hoke Dewaana
Humko Aana Padega


One who has promised, must keep that promise
No matter whether the world stops one, or even God



The eager eyes have called; the sighs of love have called
Oh, one with the lovely ways and mannerisms, stop tormenting..you have to come...



I admit that I have to leave this world
But understand that whenever you call, I must come...


I will not bear my loyalty being questioned;I have given you my heart, I will give you my life too
When I have made a pledge of love, why worry, I must come...

As long as the moon and stars shine, tell (them) our love will not break
When we madly gave ourselves to each other, we have to come....

My translation is NOT good, I want some better ones please...<lj user="inspirethoughts">?....


I have not put in my usual phonetic spelling as it's toooo much of a bother!

Update: <lj user="inspirethoughts"> brought to my mind what I had forgotten long ago...that there is a sad version of the song, too:

Thanks A! It was wonderful to see these long-forgotten words.
