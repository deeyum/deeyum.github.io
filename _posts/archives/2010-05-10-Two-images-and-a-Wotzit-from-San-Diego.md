San Diego has been an amazing visit....I never knew that with two one-year-old babies, so much could still be packed into two days...thanks to <LJ user="zweilinkefusse">, <LJ user="varshax">, and <LJ user="enesrao"> who've really taken care of us and shown us around!

Here's downtown San Diego as we came in to land:

(The airport is right next to the downtown area and it was wonderful to fly low past the buildings on the landing approach!)


Here's another flier (I think it's the Dark-eyed Junco, but perhaps this is a different bird in California) on the Spanish hacienda-type tiles, that make such beautiful patterns:

And...wotzit?

As many guesses as you wish!
