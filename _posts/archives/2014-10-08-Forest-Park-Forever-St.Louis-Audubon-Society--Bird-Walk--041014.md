It was a nice chill morning as I set out early to Forest Park.

The rising sun lit up the grasses:

A pair of 
WOOD DUCKS

 were my first sighting:

A 
MALLARD

couple also appeared:

The Mallard male is a bird of colour!

The beauty of Forest Park never fails to enthral me.

<lj-cut text="about the walk....">

I enjoyed the perky 

HOUSE SPARROWS

 while waiting for the walk to start.

Mark was leading the walk, and we set off.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292367219" title="IMG_2438 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2945/15292367219_bac9a55c1a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2438"></a>

It was great to see a female

KESTREL:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292368719" title="IMG_2443 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3934/15292368719_87169bd868_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2443"></a>

Scopes and cameras were trained on the raptor.

Notice that fall apparel is being worn!

Three

MOURNING DOVES

made a nice composition:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292598999" title="IMG_2456 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3935/15292598999_379f644731_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2456"></a>

I liked these flowers, too!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15456388276" title="IMG_2465 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3933/15456388276_4f84190526_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2465"></a>

This ground-cover plant (I'd like to know the name) makes for a carpet of tiny pink flowers:

We gathered on the bank of the creek as we watched a

BELTED KINGFISHER:

An

EASTERN PHOEBE

delighted us in the Prairie area:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292833998" title="IMG_2471 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3955/15292833998_d2372d183e_z.jpg" width="640" height="383" alt="IMG_2471"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15479499645" title="IMG_2488 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3943/15479499645_f5517f62d2_z.jpg" width="640" height="448" alt="IMG_2488"></a>

<a href="http://www.audubon.org/chapters/st-louis-audubon-society"> Mitch Leachman </a>,

as always, was a fount of information about the birds.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292923667" title="IMG_2482 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3938/15292923667_64aaabd61e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2482"></a>

He told us how watching even the everyday, backyard birds, and learning about their behaviour, would be very satisfying; something I agree with, heartily!

We spotted two

GREBES

in the water.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15292837568" title="IMG_2492 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2948/15292837568_642b3118be_z.jpg" width="640" height="413" alt="IMG_2492"></a>

When a bird sat high up on a tree, giving the Deepa Mohan pose, it took a while for me to realize it was the 

AMERICAN ROBIN:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15479621125" title="IMG_2504 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5608/15479621125_7c0afd84a5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2504"></a>

We had such a lovely time that the walk extended quite a bit!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15476476801" title="IMG_2507 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5608/15476476801_35c3d26c31_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2507"></a>

A migrating

MONARCH

alighted on my sleeve, and I realized, looking at its damaged wing, that it would not make the full journey...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15476477431" title="IMG_2513 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3943/15476477431_07ffe83bdb_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2513"></a>

I think this was a 

SAVANNAH SPARROW

but I am not sure:


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15293046767" title="IMG_2528 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3940/15293046767_94a5715aef_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_2528"></a>

We saw the Kestrel again, eating a quick breakfast:

We also sighted a mating ritual:

Here's Mitch, in front of the Muny, sharing his knowledge:

We wound up looking at the

RED-EARED SLIDERS:

I bid good-bye to yet another Monarch as I set off home:

A very enjoyable morning, thanks to the efforts of Mark for FPF, and Mitch for SLAB!
