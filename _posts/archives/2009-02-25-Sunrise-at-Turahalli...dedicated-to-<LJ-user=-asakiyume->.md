To cheer myself up after all that age-related morbidity...a set of pictures, capturing the sunrise at Turahalli last Sunday.

The melting, and strengthening, of colours is astonishing...


Pre-dawn:

Then the sun rises:

The sun behind the peepul tree at the top of the little hillock:

And behind the rocks:

And finally, after the day is established, the wonder of the cloud patterns in the sky...

Oh...you want to see a very, very beautiful image of exactly the same shot? Go to 

http://fotodreamz.blogspot.com/

and see Mahesh's shot...

Mahesh is one cameraman I have a very high regard for. He has taken the trouble to know his camera thoroughly...and is so generous about sharing the info with others, too. A trip with him is a lesson in photography each time. His composition is excellent, he elicits the best colours out of the image, and does judicious post-processing....I don't know if he will have his work on National Geographic or win awards (I suspect not!)...but hats off to him for his photography skills! I know that if and when he reads this, he will think that I am making a big thing out of nothing! 

But..it's a great pleasure when Mahesh and Priya (she has a cooking blog!) come along on a birding trip!




Use LJ-cut? Naaaaah....

Oh...these are completely un-retouched pictures. No photoshop, no Picasa, no GIMP....as I once learnt from <LJ user="sainath">, WYSWYG...what you see is what you get!
