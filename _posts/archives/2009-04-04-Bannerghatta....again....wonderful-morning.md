Today we went as an all-woman group to the Bannerghatta area beyond the large quarry, and later to the Zoo area...and the sightings were amazing, including an Egyptian Vulture, a Short-Toed Snake Eagle, a rufous male Paradise Flycatcher, White-Browed Fantail Flycatcher, the Tickell's Blue, a Blue-Capped Rock Thrush and so on and on and on.....

But there is some problem with my Gmail, and I am not able to upload pictures to my Photobucket...will have to sort it out...
