The 

<a href="http://www.birdcount.in/events/gbbc2016/campus-bird-count-2016/"> Campus Bird Count (CBC) </a>

is part of the 

<a href="http://gbbc.birdcount.org/"> Great Backyard Bird Count </a>

where on any of 4 days this year (12,13,14,15 Feb 2016), bird counts could be conducted at various educational institutions. When I was invited by Vidhya Sundar and Selvarajan Rajeshwaran, to conduct the bird count at IIM-Bangalore, I accepted with alacrity, as birders have not had access to this campus for many years now.

We had an enthusiastic group from IIMB, as well, on both days:

Saturday:

I clicked this "group selfie" at a traffic mirror on Sunday!

We got a lot of information about the various plants and trees from the horticultural experts:

For the most part, though, we were "Little Johnny Head-In-Air"....it's called Pain In The Neck birding!

Dr G  Shainesh (with Mrs Leena Shainesh, and his son Aditya, 3rd, 4th and 5th from left, front row, in the group photo above) is the Dean of Administration. He was not only supportive, but was with us from beginning to end on both days, pointing out interesting things. I wish we had such hands-on admin in all our initiatives! I found Leena very observant and knowledgeable.
