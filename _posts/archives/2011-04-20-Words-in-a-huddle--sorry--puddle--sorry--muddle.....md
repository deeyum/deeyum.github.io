On the cycling mailng list I belong to, we are having a discussion about how "peddle" is often being used instead of "pedal"...so here's my usual erudite, serious contribution:

When on your cycle, your wares you pedal,
Make sure you get around fast.... step on the peddle.
If you find two cyclists fighting, don't medal;
You don't want to win a posthumous bravery meddle.
While cycling, be careful to avoid deep poodles;
Avoid, too, each nasty biting pet  puddle.
...I hope I've got all your words in a muddle!
