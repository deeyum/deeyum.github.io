Abhinandan, Amith, Mani and I went to Ramnagara yesterday...and though we could see only one Long-billed Vulture, the sight filled us with happiness, because it was a female...sitting on a nest!

Since we have generally been seeing fewer and fewer of these birds at this place (the only nesting site in south India),...the prospect of soon seeing babies hatching was a very welcome one!

Here's the video I took, and from the zoom, you can see what a distance we maintained,in order not to disturb the bird!

I hope the Long-billed Vultures of Ramnagara at least continue to hold their numbers...
