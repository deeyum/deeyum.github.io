<P>My generalization of the day is....men are rational about everything else but love. Women..the reverse. We can be contrary, illogical, insane about everything else, but we tend to be very reasonable and pragmatic in matters of the heart. You will NOT find us marrying toyboys (er, not often, anyway)....we tend to look at the whole picture, not just the pulchritude...we would be likely to choose good providers over handsome, useless hunks.

Something just happened that brought this on, of course *smile secret smile to myself*

That's my generalization. Flak is welcome!</P>
