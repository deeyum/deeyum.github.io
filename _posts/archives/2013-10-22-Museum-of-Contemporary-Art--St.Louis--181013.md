These are four short videos I look of the work of

<a href="http://jsteinkamp.com/"> Jennifer Steinkamp </a>

which was showing as I walked past....it was just fascinating. (I've just added some music, rather than just the street noises.)

This is called "Orbit", and is the first exhibition in the Museum's new Street Views series of large-scale video works that will be projected onto CAM's facade.

<a href="http://www.camstl.org/exhibitions/main-gallery/street-views-jennifer-steinkamp/"> here's more info </a>

Hope you enjoyed that projection as much as I did!
