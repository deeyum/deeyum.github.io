I met <lj user="kalyan"> in January 2005; he had just quit his I T job and was a volunteer naturalist with JLR in K.Gudi then. I did not know, then, that we were seeing a young man at the beginning of a long and momentous journey.

Recently, my friend Radha Rangarajan  mentioned a blog-interview of Kalyan

I then started hunting for a link to the very first interview of him that I had done, which appeared in the Deccan Herald. I was worried as the link I had was returning a 404 (not found) message, but <lj user="anjali_ar"> promptly helped me out with a valid link:


<a href="http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/Feb42006/metrosat135436200623.asp"> click here </a>

to see the article, heavily edited to conform to the length required.

 In 2006, I had not even held a camera in my hands...nor did I know a Prinia from a Munia. I'm glad that I *have* been learning since those days!

I must save my old articles; it will show me how my writing has developed. I still don't think of my writing as a career in any way (if I depended on it for a living, I'd starve to death, or have to start writing far more often, which would take away the joy of it all!)

Here is some more coverage of Kalyan:

I do wish I could interview him again, at this stage in his life, when he is on the national and international stage.....let me see when I can meet this very busy celebrity :)
