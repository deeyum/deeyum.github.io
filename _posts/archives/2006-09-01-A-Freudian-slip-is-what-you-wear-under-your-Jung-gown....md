"I saw this weird looking word - something like a mutated sparrow, perched next to me last evening"</P><P>This had me laughing out loud!!</P><P>I like wordplay and I like birds, so I would really LOVE to see a weird -looking word perched next to&nbsp;him on a park bench!</P><P>Another lovely typo was by <lj user="kalyan">...I was asking for a post&nbsp; of his Yahoo days which <lj user="brainz"> referred to, about his being stuck in the toilet...and he typed back, "I am looing for it!"</P><P>And I wonder if you read my post about yet another &nbsp;friend whom I had taken to see an art exhibition, and she emailed me, "So...did you go back to see those painings?"</P><P>As <lj user="latelyontime"> would probably say:&nbsp; I love birdplay!</P>
