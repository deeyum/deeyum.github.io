As we waited for dusk, so that the Slender Lorises would become active, we were treated to the sight of a beautiful sunset.

However, as the sun sank, I watched a villager set fire to the edges of his field:

When I asked him, he said he was burning the Lantana bushes.

I am still not sure why he had to burn them, but the sun and the flames seemed to compete.

It seemed that,  along with the fires,  the whole sky was aflame:

I watched the fires rage...

I walked away down the trail and the moon and stars came into their own:
