The 3rd Sunday outing, this time to the Hulimangala area, was a very enjoyable one, with a huge stand of majestic trees that were truly breathtaking to see...and which we must enjoy before the "development" of our city wipes them out. However, squinting up into the trees to see the birds meant that birding was,literally, a pain in the neck!

We had a good turnout, and we birded at both the tree area as well as the eucalyptus plantations around, and at a small waterbody on the opposite side of the road.

One of the highlights was the sighting of the Pied Cuckoo, a winter migrant, right out in the open, on the water body.

Another delightful sight was that of  the House Sparrows hopping about near the Hulimangala school; could we miss seeing these on World Sparrow Day?)

Several of us wound up at the Lotus Restaurant in Nisarga Layout, comparing notes (and exchanging jokes!)

A few of us also went to attend the celebration of World Sparrow Day by Nature Forever, at WIPRO, Electronics City; I'll be posting a short write-up of the event on Citizen Matters shortly.

Meanwhile some of my photographs, and a short account, are
