At the Taj Malabar Hotel in Kochi (earlier Cochin) in Kerala, KM and I didn't feel like using the lift all the time and so took the service stairs to go down, but were met with this rather disturbing (well, at least thought-provoking) sign before we went out into the lobby:

Each of us, I suppose, comes to the Final Exit Door one day....

I am glad to say we seem to have made it through this door, and are still here...does that make us immortal?

Serah and Ashwin were the couple for whose marriage we came here...
