KTB drew these for her father's birthday...

KTB is on the right, in her "Elsa" dress (made for her birthday by her father's mother), giving the card to her dad; her mother is between them. Her little brother is very little indeed, and her friends Ananya and Aditi are only slightly larger!


This one seems to have a lot of hearts in it, and a nice message!
