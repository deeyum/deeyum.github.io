First I read that Yahoo is planning layoffs, then that MS is bidding for it...but what impacts me is, most of the emails I am sending on Yahoo are bouncing back or just being undelivered, which can cause problems, y'know, and misunderstandings...at least 3 emails have disappeared, and today I emailed <LJ user="idahoswede"> and it promptly bounced back...

As they say here, "what gives?" All you techies on my friends' list..do you have answers?
