There is such an incredible variety of creatures around us, it's like having a treasure house surrounding us!

In the second, the creature is further out of its "shell":

In the third, almost the entire worm is visible.

This, Saandip Nandagudi tells me, is the BAGWORM caterpillar (Pachythelia sp), and it has collected the leaf-clutter around itself as a protective casing (which might also become its pupa later.)



Of course, I suddenly remembered I could take a video...

On Sunday, as we walked through the forest, we came upon another marvel...the walking twig!

Can you spot it in this picture?

You can see it to the left of the tree trunk here, long lines of life:

And here, too:

Meet "Twiggy", the STICK INSECT, (I named her after a famous model!)....here she is in action!

I think I am  content just roaming the scrub jungle, looking at all these little wonders!
