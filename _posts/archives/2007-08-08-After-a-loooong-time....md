I had a friend over from St Louis tonight; he has just quit Citibank and joined Wipro. For a long time, I knew that he played the mridangem, but recently he gave a vocal concert in St Louis! So I asked him to sing...and he sang for nearly an hour.

After ages, instead of listening to a visitor singing movie songs or ghazals,I actually heard just Carnatic music...and it was balm to the soul. Usually, at gatherings, it is I who wind up singing; it was a pleasant change to be able to enjoy someone else's music in such an informal setting. Poor Lakshmanan, he got to eat his dinner only at 10.30pm!

I feel at peace and happy now. I do wish I had more friends around who would sing Carnatic music like this...it's a wonderful treasure that I cannot indulge in as often as I want to. When I was growing up, I was surrounded by people who could sing, play the violin or the mridangam, and almost every evening there would be impromptu gatherings and excellent music...only today I realized how much I miss those evenings.

I thought, also, of my friends Murali and his youngest sister,<LJ user="wondernoon">, who are also crazy about Carnatic music...they would have loved to be here this evening. Oh well, Murali lives in Memphis, Tenn, not far from St Louis...so I plan, next time I am there, to introduce Lakhmanan to him!

A wonderful evening...thanks to Lakshmanan!

and btw...a nice line for all my Indian friends...Lakshman is REALLY married to...Rekha!
