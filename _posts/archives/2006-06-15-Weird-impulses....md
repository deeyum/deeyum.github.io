Was sitting and practising my Carnatic music for the chamber concert next month, when I was assailed by the irresistible urge to sing&nbsp; the beautiful song, "zaraa see aahat" (I&nbsp;also had a vivid&nbsp;mental image of &nbsp;the beauty of Priya Rajvansh in the video clip of the movie that I have watched a few times on TV)...so left off Simhendra Madhyamam and sang that instead! (mem. my singing on both counts is rusty!)
