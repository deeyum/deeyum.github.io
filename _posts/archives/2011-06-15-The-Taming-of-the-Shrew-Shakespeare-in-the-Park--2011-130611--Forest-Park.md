Here's the 1950's set of the play:

There was a side-show, a short adaption, introducing the characters, on another stage, nearby (I shot this sitting on the grass in the main area, so some chairs intervene):

There were some wandering minstrels (they were, truly, wandering all over the audience area!):

I am sure they were playing some Elizabethan instruments!

Here's my friend Dawn, with me:
