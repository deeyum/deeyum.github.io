It's all very well to decorate one's car with the symbols of one's faith:

 <a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n611/allsrtspctrs/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7180.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n611/allsrtspctrs/IMG_7180.jpg" border="0" alt="drwng on wndshld 220112"></a>

But this seems to leave, quite literally, a very small window of vision for the driver, and almost none at all for the passenger in front.

Are such "windshield decorations" legal? More important, are they safe?
