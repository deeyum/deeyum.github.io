I took a little while...well, about 8 tries...to find out how this works. Pretty simple when you think of it!

Great fun while it lasts, though! Try it on children, especially, and hear the incredulous "HOW....?"

<lj-cut text="Here's how it works">

For any two-digit no., the number minus the sum of its digits is always a multiple of 9. So they just assign a symbol to all the multiples of 9 below 90 (it doesn't work after that)...and that's what you will see. Just to prevent you from spotting it, they assign a different symbol to the multiples each time you try it! 
 
So next time you try it, look at the symbol assigned to all the multiples of 9 on the chart!

Neatly done, and very well packaged!
