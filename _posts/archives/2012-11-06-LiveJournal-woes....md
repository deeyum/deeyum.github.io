I am, most often, NOT able to post comments on friends' blogposts. Forgive me friends, I'm not guilty of snootiness...it is increasingly rare for me to be able to post comments.

All I am getting is spam, spam and MORE SPAM comments. I don't want to make this a "LJ friends only" place, as I know that several non-LJ friend read my LJ....so what do I do? Yes, at least now, most of the stupid spam is screened, I've done that much.

So...remember...I *am* reading most of your posts in between my travels...please don't mind that I am not commenting....it's not "won't" but "can't"!
