Here's Mr KM, with the monkey balloon that I bought him (for various obscure reasons)....

I have no clue how he *really* looks, because I still see the 28.5-year-old whom I married...let's see...32.5 years ago!

Oh, by the way...the monkey is on the right.


And no, the S3 MLC is NOT back yet...this is the 20D with the 50mm lens...I miss my MLC SOOOO much!
