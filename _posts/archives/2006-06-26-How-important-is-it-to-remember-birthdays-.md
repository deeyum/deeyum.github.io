I have forgotten, I find, to wish&nbsp;two&nbsp;close friend son their birthdays recentlyy...and also realize that one friend's daughter, recently married, celebrated her &nbsp;birthday was a few days ago. I don't really set all that much store by birthdays, but don't want to upset anyone else's feelings or make them feel that&nbsp; not remembering birthday=not caring for them....so I feel bad if I forget. Are birthdays important milestones? Or are they days like other days, as my husband holds, and should any day when you are healthy and happy be celebrated? As Alice said, one has only one birthday and 364 unbirthdays...what should one do?
