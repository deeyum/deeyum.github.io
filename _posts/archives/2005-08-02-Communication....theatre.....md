When each of us uses a word, we seem to mean something that is different from what another person sees in it....I sometimes wonder how communication is possible at all! 

Went to see a Girish Karnad play, Hayavadana. How lovely to see a professionally done play! Great acting, good costumes, sets, lighting, music....Mr N Ravi Kumar is a director to be praised indeed. He is taking the initiative to bring translated Kannada theatre to a non-Kannada audience, and doing it very well.

Hayavadana is a parable about what constitutes a "person"...his head and its contents, or his body and its contents. A most interesting concept, developed with humour.
