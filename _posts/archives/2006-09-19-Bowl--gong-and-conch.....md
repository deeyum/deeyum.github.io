<P>......



I loved the composition of these things on the steps of the Gopalaswamy Temple in Bandipur...The mendicant sounds the conch and rings the gong with that stick...and hopefully, the copper bowl will be filled by devotees visiting the temple! The owner of these had gone for a break somewhere....
