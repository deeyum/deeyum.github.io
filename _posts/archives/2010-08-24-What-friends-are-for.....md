Was sitting at my laptop, feeling uncharacteristically blue...missing daughter, grand-daughter, and the lovely feeling of being able to care for them actively (instead of seeing them passively on Skype, which I must say is the next best substitute) ....it was lovely to get a ping on Gtalk from <a href="http://chandanv.blogspot.com/"> Chandan </a>....just a few words, chatting with him about photographs, and mist....meant that I "mist" my little ones much less than usual!

Friends...are the greatest treasure of my life. If you've heard this before, it's because I think that thought several times each day!


I'm sure this Rock Agama is smiling because it's thinking of a friend...
