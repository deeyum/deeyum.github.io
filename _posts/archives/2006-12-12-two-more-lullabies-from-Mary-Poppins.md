I have not posted some lullabies for a long time now...but on the loooong flight across the Pond, I watched "Mary Poppins", and here goes:


There isn't any need to translate!

Stay awake--don't rest your head
Don't lie down upon your bed
While the moon drifts in the skies
Stay awake...don't close your eyes

Though the world is fast asleep
Though your pillow's soft and deep
You're not sleepy as you seem
Stay awake..don't nod and dream...
Stay awake...don't nod and dream.....


And here's the one where Mary Poppins upends the paperweight which shows St Paul's...an interesting footnote is that feeding the birds is no longer permitted in London's Trafalgar Square, because the pigeons have become such pests!

Early each day
To the steps of St Paul's
The little bird-woman comes
In her own special way
To the people she calls,
"Come buy my bag full of crumbs!

"Come feed the little birds
Show them you care...
And you'll be glad if you do....
Their nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence from you....

"Feed the birds!
Tuppence a bag!
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag!"


"Feed the birds!" that's what she cries--
While overhead, her birds fill the skies;
All around the cathedral
The saints and the apostles
Look down as she sells her wares
Although you can't see it
You know they are smiling
Each time someone shows that he cares....

Though her words are simple and few
Listen...listen...she's calling to you...
"Feed the birds...tuppence a bag...
Tuppence! Tuppence!Tuppence a bag..."

Though her words are simple and few
Listen...listen...she's calling to you...:
"Feed the birds...tuppence a bag...
Tuppence! Tuppence! Tuppence a bag!"


(Both songs from 'Mary Poppins' by Disney)
