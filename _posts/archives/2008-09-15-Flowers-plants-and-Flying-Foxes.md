Some of the flowers that I photographed during the Mysore trip; I have no clue about the id's (I never ever seem to see the same plant twice!!)...so here goes:

They may have no name as far as I am concerned, but they are still so beautiful:

I thought of <LJ user="asakiyume"> who would know which to smell, which to brew into tea, and which to avoid!

I wonder if this is related to the DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Potato Plant) which has similar, but much larger, flowers:

Ah, one I know. This is the WILD JASMINE and gives off a heavenly, heady scent:

Apart from the damselflies and dragonflies I posted about earlier, I found this CRICKET,too:

I wondered if these TERMITE NESTS were now home to snakes:

On the way back, at Bidadi, I caught sight of some trees with hundreds of fruit bats hanging from them, and we all got off to take pictures:

Here's a snap that explains why they are called "flying foxes":

Here are two fruit bats, bickering amongst themselves:

Ah, that's the Mysore trip done...if it takes me a week to document a two-day trip, that's not very efficient!
