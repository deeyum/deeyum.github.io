Attended a demonstration of projects in contemporary puppetry yesterday..my account is at


http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/blogs/show_entry/789-ifa-grants

(I think it's a good idea to put all the Bangalore stuff into my Citizen Matters blog...)

At the entrance was this...er...entrancing arrangement:

I stayed for a few minutes, just savouring the beauty of that! I wonder which faceless hotel employee created that?


There is so much art and beauty around us...and we sometimes don't have the time to appreciate it!


and on a separte note...how did "entrance" get two such widely divergent meanings?
