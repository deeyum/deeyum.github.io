My daughter just posted this on FB...so I cannot resist sharing the flowers that fill my life with beauty, colour, fragrance and sometimes a lot of peskiness...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14280901415" title="kk 260514 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5522/14280901415_b120c0f397_z.jpg" width="640" height="385" alt="kk 260514"></a>

I went through a fairly thorough personal interview at the Swedish embassy about my proposed (and already paid for!) visit...and I told the lady about <LJ user="idahoswede">, <LJ user="kejn">, <LJ user="pondhopper"> and <LJ user="prashanthchengi">...she even took down everyone's LJ id's....and how I hope to meet all of you in Sweden. 

I am not sure I did right in saying that my plans for travelling in the Schengen area are a little fluid. But that's the way it is...so...that's votIsed.

Oh well...hope to meet all of you....I may not be able to see your LJ's all the time or comment...but you lot are true friends and you are one of the main reason why I am visiting (or trying to visit) Sweden!

Also add Deepak and Sumana Vastare (who live in Goteborg with their 7-month-old son Advik) to the list....

Can't type too well because I have my fingers crossed, and my eyes, too! The decision will be made, and the yes or no stamped on my passport, which I can collect from the Embassy tomorrow, at 3pm...
