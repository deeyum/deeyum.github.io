Circa 2006:

Me to my friend: "We can meet at Shoppers' Stop, opposite my home."

That branch of Shoppers' Stop had just been opened, and when my friend told the auto driver, "Shoppers'Stop", he was taken to Magrath Road about 11 km from my home, and we had a fine time with him saying, "But I am at Shoppers' Stop!" and me saying, "But I can't see you!"

I had to clarify that "my" Shoppers' Stop was on Bannerghatta Road.

Last week (November 2015):

Me to my friend: "We can meet at Shoppers' Stop, opposite my home." I added, very carefully, "On Bannerghatta Road."

So my friend located Shoppers' Stop on Bannerghatta Road...and went to the newly-opened outlet (which I didn't know about) on Bannerghatta Road at Meenakshi Mall, about 6 km from my home, and (here's the refrain)

 we had a fine time with him saying, "But I am at Shoppers' Stop!" and me saying, "But I can't see you!"

MOTS. I should not use Shoppers' Stop as a landmark, any more.
