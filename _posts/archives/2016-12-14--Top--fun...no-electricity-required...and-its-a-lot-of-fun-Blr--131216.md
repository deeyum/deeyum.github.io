I decided to show K2 how tops work, and I wondered if I still had the old skill. The first two tries did not work, but on the 3rd attempt...

(I had to throw the top and then pick up the camera!)

Here's K2 demonstrating the best way to enjoy a spinning top.

Here's the top:

Obviously, watching it upside down between one's feet is good:

Then he comes closer, only to be stopped by my warning not to touch it!

We had an hour or so of this...I  hope, one day, to see him very proficient with the top,too!

Traditional pastimes for children, which are delightful, and require no electricity!
