It's been really hectic, but I have finally found the time...it's going to be a long post,compressing two days at the Serengeti, with lots of photos (there will be one lot more with pics from Lake Manyara, with the TREE-CLIMBING LIONS)

Here's a sunrise over the Serengeti plains...

<LJ user="anushsh"> has made this his screensaver....so this is dedicated to him!


Our safari started on a high note, with this sighting of a CHEETAH, which had just killed a gazelle and was dragging it to a good place for the feast....

(Remember, I said that none of my cheetah shots are close-up or good!)


Another "typical" shot that I got was the Masai, walking for miles in the vast landscape, amongst the eternal grasses of the Serengeti...

<lj-cut text="lots of pictures under the cut; you must have a lot of interest in wildlife, and lots of time..othwrwise, skip!">


Another "typical Africa" picture is of the GIRAFFE amongst the FLAT-TOP ACACIAS....

and just for fun, I got these "giraffe front-and-back" pics:

We saw several more (hundreds!) of the SOCIABLE WEAVER BIRDS:

Here's the DIK-DIK, talk about doe-eyed beauty!

Some more of the TOPI (mother and child, who is a young adult) came into sight:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094471080/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1406/1094471080_9c58108084_o.jpg" width="480" height="399" alt="Topi in the savannah" /></a>

Here's the WHITE-BROWED COUCAL;


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093601223/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1248/1093601223_a80d9b7e3e_o.jpg" width="470" height="480" alt="White-browed coucal" /></a>

And another of my favourite mother-and-child shots, this time of the OLIVE BABOON:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094562132/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/1094562132_e8007dbe59_o.jpg" width="480" height="467" alt="Olive Baboon with baby" /></a>


some IMPALA were grazing nearby:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1134575278/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1240/1134575278_7bc8b9e7a1_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="impala portrait" /></a>

Soon a large herd of ELEPHANTS crossed the track:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093707543/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1108/1093707543_7875bf5410_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="mothers and children" /></a>

And here's one of them having a snack on the go....



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093712037/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1112/1093712037_fa1c578fe6_o.jpg" width="480" height="313" alt="snacks to go..." /></a>


Here's a young one having a dust-bath:




<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1133233657/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1180/1133233657_11a4c15f8a_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="elephant having mudbath" /></a>




At one point, we saw a kill that the main predators and the hyenas had finished with, and the VULTURES had moved in:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093733577/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1260/1093733577_d2e3b9709b_o.jpg" width="479" height="390" alt="Vultures at the kill with a marabour stork" /></a>

A MARABOU STORK is on the left-hand side, hoping for some pickings.

It was not an amicable distribution of the spoils, lots of bickering went on:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093756263/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1318/1093756263_e4db7aab3f_o.jpg" width="480" height="314" alt="I'm going to scare you off the kill" /></a>

If you look carefully, you can see, in the photo above, both the WHITE-BACKED and the LAPPET-FACED VULTURES. We never got to see the critically endangered LAMMERGEIER VULTURE.



We saw several LAPPET-FACED VULTURES homing in on the kill:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093586007/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/1093586007_52cb55f213_o.jpg" width="391" height="480" alt="lappet-faced vulture" /></a>


And many MARABOU STORKS in the acacias around, waiting to come in, too:

There were some RUPPELL'S GRIFFON VULTURES around, too:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1114083178/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1359/1114083178_d04fdaaba0_o.jpg" width="480" height="407" alt="Ruppell's Griffon Vultures" /></a>

Other birds that we saw included the GROUND HORNBILL



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1117932130/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1221/1117932130_9f6c56d349_o.jpg" width="454" height="480" alt="ground hornbill" /></a>


the HELMETED GUINEA FOWL

the AFRICAN LOVEBIRDS, making lovely dots of colour against the sky(they were pretty far off, though!)


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094704196/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1285/1094704196_faade9d117_o.jpg" width="480" height="359" alt="african lovebirds" /></a>

I was able to get a better shot of the AFRICAN FISHING EAGLE:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1122357523/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1339/1122357523_30712dfb7d_o.jpg" width="480" height="412" alt="African Fishing Eagle" /></a>

and one of the LONG-TAILED FISCAL SHRIKE:

Here's the AUGUR BUZZARD...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1123219414/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1213/1123219414_1da5806c09_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="Augur Buzzard" /></a>

the AFRICAN GREY HORNBILL:

Some WHITE-HEADED BUFFALO WEAVERS, which accompany the AFRICAN BUFFALOES everywhere, picking ticks off their backs and feasting on the seeds and insects the animals' hoooves churn up:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061536619/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1379/1061536619_6e1ffff028_o.jpg" width="439" height="480" alt="white-headed buffalo weavers" /></a>

The BATELEUR EAGLE, however, kept such a distance that only such silhouetter shots were possible:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1062397664/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1045/1062397664_37ccc4f255_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Bateleur Eagle...practically a silhouette!" /></a>


Here's a RED-BILLED STORK in flight:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1134580668/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/1134580668_344a1f8051_o.jpg" width="467" height="480" alt="stork in flight" /></a>

And a GREAT WHITE PELICAN:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1133721277/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1363/1133721277_c750b3b337_o.jpg" width="403" height="480" alt="pelican in flight" /></a>


And there was another BARE-FACED GO-AWAY BIRD posing for us; for all that their name said, they never went away, and we kept sighting them!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094649418/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1167/1094649418_15bab4e846_o.jpg" width="388" height="480" alt="bare-faced go-away bird" /></a>







We stopped for lunch at the Serengeti Visitor's Centre, which also has a small hillock giving a view of the endless space that the word "Serengeti" actually means.

There we found a TREE HYRAX in the middle of a bush:




<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061774897/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1174/1061774897_308579d5e7_o.jpg" width="480" height="346" alt="Tree Hyrax at Serengeti Visitors' Centre" /></a>


There were colourful Masai shawls on sale:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1062614888/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1233/1062614888_8131d4a12b_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="The colourful shawls of the Masai" /></a>


Later, we were lucky enough to see another CHEETAH, taking its ease in the shade...also somewhat far off, though...



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061765281/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1417/1061765281_551eed81f7_o.jpg" width="480" height="387" alt="magnificient animal" /></a>


As if to remind us that the savannah is not always a haven of co-existence, we would see sights such as this HIPPO SKULL (though Huruma told us it might have died of natural causes, too.)


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093823679/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1341/1093823679_cdc9883d5a_o.jpg" width="480" height="368" alt="Hippo skull (died of natural causes)" /></a>


Another amazing thing was the very heavy, unseasonal rainstorm which prevented us from leaving on time for the evening safari on the second day; but the plus was that several animals came out on to the road because of the rain. We had an excellent sighting of the BLACK MAMBA (will try and get a pic from my brother in law!) and we saw these PYGMY MONGOOSE:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094613040/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1315/1094613040_1d6b3b93b6_o.jpg" width="480" height="420" alt="pygmy mongoose" /></a>

and this BLACK-BACKED JACKAL:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094613592/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1111/1094613592_90525e9752_o.jpg" width="380" height="480" alt="Black-backed Jackal" /></a>






We went to various parts of the GRUMETI RIVER; and each scene was  a special sight. We started with the BLACKSMITH LAPWING, which we call the PLOVER in India:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1078883507/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1295/1078883507_ca3108843d_o.jpg" width="420" height="479" alt="Blacksmith lapwing" /></a>



There was another of my favourite mother-and-child images, this time a EUROPEAN GOOSE and her gosling:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094687814/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1139/1094687814_04f8489c56_o.jpg" width="480" height="422" alt="European goose and gosling" /></a>



Then, of course, our eyes were drawn by the HIPPOPOTAMUS:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093708193/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/1093708193_0e9c705925_o.jpg" width="478" height="480" alt="in the swim..." /></a>

Here are three of them:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094574778/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1134/1094574778_55ee4c4ec3_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="Three hippopotami" /></a>

But hippos were not the only animals in the water...we soon realized some of the patterns in the water were pretty deadly...


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1094577882/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1241/1094577882_2015b0164f_o.jpg" width="480" height="158" alt="deadly patterns in the water" /></a>

Here are some more shots of the CROCODILES...the water had eyes, and teeth:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093730721/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1422/1093730721_f29d6e7c3e_o.jpg" width="479" height="345" alt="the water has eyes and teeth..." /></a>


Near the water, we saw many SWALLOW-TAILED BEE-EATERS, too..


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1123201380/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1417/1123201380_67ba48724b_o.jpg" width="353" height="480" alt="Swallow-tailed bee-eater" /></a>


I took a snap of this un-id' fruit on a creeper:




<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1133265137/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1075/1133265137_7ba0e7bce0_o.jpg" width="372" height="480" alt="un id fruit on a creeper" /></a>


And took a quick macro shot of thie BUTTERFLY on an ALOE VERA flower:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1093820101/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1280/1093820101_71fe465c1c_o.jpg" width="323" height="479" alt="butterfly on aloe vera flowers" /></a>



We then proceeded to see several tocky outcrops in the savannah, which, Huruma told us, are called "Simba Kopje" (Lion Rock) as very often lions sit on them to sun themselves as they scan for prey....and promptly, as if to oblige us, we saw one beautiful lioness taking her ease, sunning herself on a rock!

And, at the end of the day, we found this LION well-feed and sleepy, barely wanting to lift his head to register our presence...he promptly rolled over and went to sleep..and was still there after half an hour when we passed back that way!

I will wind up the Serengeti pictures with this delta image of the vulture in flight:
