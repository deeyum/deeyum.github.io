Here's an image I liked a lot...

Today, I met someone who was my neighbour many years ago; he remarried after the death of his wife. My friend remarked, "Why does he want to marry at that age?" And I took exception, because I cannot believe that any age is the wrong age to marry. If one needs someone by one's side, for whatever reason, and is willing to make the commitment for it, and feels happy in the relationship, should age be a bar to that?

I just cannot agree with those who feel that marriage is only for a particular age group. And I object to the age-ism that unthinkingly makes such pronouncements.

What do you all feel? Must all adults turn more and more spiritual as they age (well, that's what Hinduism says...after grihastaashrama, comes vAnaprasthAshramA, heading towards sannyAsam or total renunciation) , or should it (as I believe) be a choice that they can, and should, make themselves?
