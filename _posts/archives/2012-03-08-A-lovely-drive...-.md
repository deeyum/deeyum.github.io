How beautiful it is to drive through the Arsikere area.... And see the roadside trees....the Neem, the Tamarind, the Mango..... And the varieties of Ficus, Peepal, Banyan, and others, sporting different colours of leaves, from the reddish copper of the new leaves, to the bright green, and then the darker green of the mature leaves. Even the exotics like the Rain trees, the  Gulmohar, the Copper Pods, the Tabebuia aurea,, and the Jacarndas, are in full bloom now....

We will arrive at the Bhadra River Tern Lodge shortly....but the trees on the way have been as wonderful as the birds (about 65 species so far) that we have seen.
