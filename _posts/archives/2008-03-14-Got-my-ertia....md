Immediately I made my last post, I went and got my swimsuit and OFFIWENT. And frankly, when I stepped into the pre-swim shower, AND when I stepped into the pool, I regretted it. I think my eerie water-is-too-COLD cry could be heard in all the flats in my apartment building and mothers are still probably comforting their trembling toddlers. There was a fair wind blowing today, too, and it was cooler than it usually is at this time of year...... and it felt, for the first 5 or 6 laps, as if someone had filled up the pool with the contents of their just-melted ice trays. Well, I didn't actually see polar bears or the march of the penguins, but you get the...drift? 

But I stuck to it, did my usual 30 laps (it's a little pool...call it a poolette, or a pooling) that's about...perhaps those 30 laps are equal to 15 full-size pool laps, maybe 20...wish it's the latter! Must find out the dimensions of our poolette...) and felt cold...in fact, for a little while, I had a complexion of a delicate and intriguing shade of blue... but was warmed by the feeling that YES... I did it! (as Higgins says in My Fair Lady). 

I do love the great fresh feeling swimming gives, and also the fact that I keep my dinner all ready on the table, and come back and tuck in guiltlessly!

Thank you for the nudge, <LJ user="inspirethoughts">!

Go to Google Earth. Go to Bangalore. Go to Casa Ansal Apartments...and that little dot going up and down, up and down, up and down....is ME!! :))))

Tra-la, off to Lalbagh tomorrow morning...
