Her eyes tight shut,
She sleeps, her mouth in a beautiful bow; 
Is she dreaming?
What do babies dream about?
I don't know...

All I know is, my heart goes out to her.
I caress her downy cheek.
I must live half a world away from her...
I must get used to not having her in my life
After having seen her, every hour,every day, every week...
