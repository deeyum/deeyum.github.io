When I was about to go to my tent at JLR Bannerghatta, I looked up at the full moon, serenely riding the night skies.

And the next night, when I looked out of my balcony, the moon was rising, still looking full:

Having taken a zoom shot, I got the moon through the palm fronds:

is my entry about the moon, some time ago. I promised <LJ user="asakiyume"> that I would post the Tamizh film song about the moon....alas, I cannot find the original video anywhere on Youtube. The only video which has the original soundtrack does not give me a URL to post....can someone help me? The song is "andru vanthathum athE nilA".
