The butterfly kisses the marigolds...

The bee kisses the cosmos....

And I...kiss another little flower!

Here's a nice limerick on kisses:


A lady loved her Mr
And she liked it when he Kr
But she liked it far less
(and made a ruckus, I confess!)
When her Mr Kr Sr!


And some more thoughtful lines:

Strephon kissed me in the spring
Robin in the fall;
But Colin only looked at me
And never kissed at all.

Srtephon's kiss was lost in jest,
Robin's lost in play:
But the kiss in Colin's eyes
Haunts me night and day.

I never knew that this was by

who was a poet from St.Louis!
