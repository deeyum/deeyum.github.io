Just outside the 

<a href="http://www2.fi.edu/"> Franklin Institute </a>

near the 

<a href="http://www2.fi.edu/theater/planetarium/theater-info.php"> Fels Planetarium </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7365.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7365.jpg" border="0" alt="fels planetarium"></a>


was the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_BB-1_Pioneer"> Budd BB1 Pioneer aircraft </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7364.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7364.jpg" border="0" alt="Budd BB-1 Pioneer aircraft"></a>

One of the few aircraft built of stainless steel, which I would not have thought a great material for an aircraft...but it logged more than a 1000 hours!


<lj-cut text="a few more places and sights that I saw">

The 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Circle_%28Philadelphia%29"> Logan Circle Fountain </a>

which is also called the Swann Fountain or the Amazon Fountain (it was originally a site for public executions!)

looked really lovely:

Here's one statue of an Amazon:

And here's a little boy getting away from the ladies!

This is the fountain at night:

This was another fountain that I didn't get the name of...by night...

One buiding had this little decoration, showing the local sights:

you can see the tiger in the Zoo, and the development of the American flag!


Philly is known for its murals, and I spotted several beautiful ones:

that one of the downtown scenery does not contain the Comcast building, which came up later!

The details on the

<a href="http://www.pagrandlodge.org/"> Masonic Temple </a>

were so intricate:

The sculptures captivated me, too.

This one is about the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust"> Holocaust</a>:

This one's of Sylvester Stallone as

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Balboa_%28film%29"> Rocky Balboa </a>

There is usually a queue to take photographs here!

I enjoyed seeing two sculptures which had to do with laundry! What! you ask...here they are:

To help dry the laundry:

And then to make it presentable:

The 

<a href="http://citypaper.net/articles/2009/10/01/design-philadelphia-2009"> Welcome House </a>

as part of the interactive "Living in a Box" exhibit was being built the previous evening:

And the next day, some artists were painting on the glass walls, drawing some onlookers:

The iconic, eponymous sculpture of 

<a href="http://www.fairmountpark.org/jfkplaza.asp"> Love Park </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7039.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7039.jpg" border="0" alt="love park 031009"></a>

was drawing lots of visitors,

and the pink fountain 
<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7317.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7317.jpg" border="0" alt="041009 love square fountain"></a>

and bright pink water

were very intriguing!

The Cathedral Basilica of the Saints Peter and Paul (er, not Mary!) merits a post to itself; I must thank Madhu for taking me there..in fact, Madhu did an amazing job of spending a LOT of her precious weekend with me, walking around.

Let me close with this touch of humour:
