In the state of Karnataka, temples to the Monkey God (called AnjanEyA or the son of Anjana, or Hanuman or the One with the broken chin) are very common, but on our drive from Hospet to Daroji, while we were waiting at a railway crossing, I noticed an unusual temple:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_1756.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_1756.jpg" border="0" alt="vali sugriva temple hospet 100910"></a>


This temple seems to depict the battle between

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vali_%28Ramayana%29"> Vali </a>

and

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugriva"> SugrIva </a>

...that's when I realized that I was in the kingdom of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Episode_from_Kishkinda_Kanda.jpg"> Kishkinda </a>

land of the monkeys and the bears, and  of the forests where they live! Mythology and reality mesh seamlessly in this land where I live....
