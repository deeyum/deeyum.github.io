One, while waiting at Central Station, Chennai:

I can just imagine the criminal innocently sitting in front of the camera which, of course, knows immediately that this person is a criminal, and starts watching him...


The next delightful thing was in my coach.

It says, "Hammer for breaking the window glass during emergency". 

Now to find a hammer to break the glass of the window in which this hammer is kept...


And the last...make no mistake, there will be no teetotallers on this train...
