My wildlife experience is inextricably tied up with the several avid wildlifers I have met. Just now when I saw <lj user="sainath">'s post about the Grey Headed Fishing Eagle, I instantly thought of <lj user="yathin">...even though HE now signs himself Elephas Maximus! So I was musing..and I realize that I think of some particular fauna when I see the names of some people...let me describe the associations at least with some LJ-ers!

<lj user="kalyan">....the bonnet macaques of BR Hills and the Crested Serpent Eagle which he pointed out to us when we first met him in that magical place...

<lj user="amoghavarsha">...that rock python which he photographed..and the Forest Calottus.
<lj user="sanathreddy">...the crocodile....
<lj user="sainath">...the Spotted Owlet....
<lj user="chirdeep_shetty">...the dhole and the chital, the former usually hunting the latter!
<lj user="kaadupapa">..no, not the kaadupapa (the Slender Loris), but the elephants which he snapped in that beautiful photograph...

And so it goes...
