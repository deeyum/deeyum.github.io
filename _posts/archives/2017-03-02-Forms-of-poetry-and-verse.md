My friend Janet asked for 10 prompts about which she would write haikus.

To this, someone asked:

"Yeh haiku kaiku?" (Why this haiku?)

And my response was:

When we cannot think
Straight, or write words as is done--
We pen a haiku!

To this Chiddu said:

I love to ride my bike-u
This is my 1st two line haiku!

and I responded with a limerick:

When we talked of haiku
And someone asked, "Yeh kaiku?"
Though you made a bhool
And you broke the rule
Your haiku on baiku...I laiku!

(bhool=mistake in Hindi)

I love bu**-shi##ing in verse!
