Laptop crashes in a flash...but resuscitation (spelling?) takes such eons....as expected, the recovery disk given with the laptop would format the system so extensive backups had to be taken...now the machine still does not accept wifi and I am not able to send messages on the broadband account...feel frustrated, inexperienced, and...er....bugged!

Thank goodness all this happened a few days BEFORE departure...I am hoping that by the time I get back, Chandan would have got my laptop jumping through e-hoops again. 

Sadly, I realize that putting the backup CD's on my CD drive will only get the date back into the system but I will have to restore lots of stuff manually...just the thought of redoing my address book appals me....
