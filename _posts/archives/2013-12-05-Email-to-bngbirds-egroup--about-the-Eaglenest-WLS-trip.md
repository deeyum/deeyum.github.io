On a tour organized by Geetanjali Dhar's IT Nature Club, ten of us visited Nameri (a morning's birding) and Eaglenest Wild Life Sanctuary (WLS) at Lama and Bompu Camps.

Though several experienced birders asked us why we were going at the end of November, the birding exceeded all our expectations. On the very first day, I saw two Buguns, and a couple of days later, we got to see seven of the birds, so I cannot but feel that these birds are thriving in the areas around Eaglenest, if a bunch of amateurs like us could see so many!

Other highlights were the Fire-tailed Myzornis, the Chestnut-headed Tesia, the Red-headed Trogon and a female Ward's Trogon...I think it was only the Tragopan (on the list of some of the "focus" birders) that eluded us. I don't think any of us have ever had such a list of lifers before this!

<lj-cut text="want to read more?">

Our guides were excellent. Binanda, who is a regular guide with Geetanjali, made sure that all of us (or at least, as many as possible) saw each bird, even though most of the birds of Eaglenest are in-the-clutter skulkers, and small-sized, too, sometimes. Khandu, the guide at Lama Camp, has incredible spotting skills. We were equally lucky to have Lobsang Tsering as a guide. He was at Bompu Camp, training the staff there...a six-month project after which he will move on. On the day we were driving back to Lama Camp, he took us to a place where he said he would find the Fire-tailed Myzornis....found it...and all of us were able to have a look at it (alas, no chance of observing any behaviour...we were thrilled at our sighting!). The bazooka-bearers, of course, had several field days with their photographs, but the rest of us (some of us did not even carry cameras, only binoculars) were extremely pleased at the sightings, and we know that the DSLR photos will be shared....so that saves us the bother of lugging around heavy cameras, and looking for ways to charge them overnight!

One of my personal favourites was watching a Wallcreeper bathing and disporting itself in the waters of the Kameng river, and I also took videos of a far-away Forktail, and a Trogon, on the opposite bank of the river, both of which we watched for a while. The Beautiful Nuthatch and the Beautiful Sibia are truly beautiful...but how can this adjective be applied only to a few of the birds? All of them are stunningly beautiful! I also mistook the Black-faced Warbler for the Yellow-bellied Fantail, and was corrected by Binanda.

Two major "dips"  for me at Nameri were the Wreathed and Rufous-necked Hornbills, which I had seen in plenty just past the Eco-camp walking towards the Jia Bharolli river on my last visit.  We also arrived at Pakke far too late to do any birding, and the awful roads mandated a very early departure, in order to catch flights at Guwahati later in the day. 

For the most part, this time, I was content to just see the incredibly beautiful birds that Subbu and Mohanram treated us to in 2008 ( the time from whichn I date my "Eaglenest Itch"!)  by word and image.  I did not  miss my DSLR or the 300mm lens. Since the others' bazooka shots will also be up shortly,  I am very happy to say that I used the two best cameras in the world, that Nature has provided me with.....and enjoyed the birds, the many butterflies, the beautiful wildflowers, and the superb, awe-inspiring scenery.

In similar fashion, you can see photographs of all of the long list below...and I hope it will inspire you to visit Eaglenest WLS, a paradise on earth that the Bugun tribe cares for.
