Advik put on the new anklets I bought for him, and looked more of a laddu than ever:

Meanwhile, Sumana's masala rice was excellent:

The colours of summer beckoned us outdoors.

Creatures such as this 

DAMSELFLY

rewarded our outing!

Wildflowers grew in their hundreds, adding beauty to the meadows.

This looked like Queen Anne's Lace,but was perhaps something else:

Buttercups shone golden in the sun:

Daisies daily:

Honeysuckle spread its heady scent:

Waterlilies bloomed in the pond:

Rain was not very far away, but held off:

A baby

WHITE WAGTAIL

strutted about:

GULLS

posed:

JACKDAWS

with their white eyes were everywhere!

A FINCH

female peeked at me:

Then she watched a

BLACKBIRD

bathing:

EURASIAN TREE SPARROWS

were everywhere:

WOOD PIGEONS

walked along:

EURASIAN MAGPIES 

are the crows of this area:

I saw my first

FIELDFARES:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14231206918" title="IMG_0256 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3924/14231206918_a9ecac60b4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0256"></a>

These are thrushes and behave exactly as our thrushes do back home, turning over the leaf-litter and foraging.

A 

HOODED CROW

was a hidden crow, in the foliage:

Some acquatic flower that I don't know the name of:

The greenery was lush and inviting:

A flowing stream:

and a fish in it:
