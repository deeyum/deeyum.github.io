Well, one does also document the human presence at all points....! Here are a few images of the most successful mammal (in terms of breeding and presence) on earth...


This is Half Dome, and if you look closely, those ants are....people...

Here's a video where I zoom in. It's not *really* surprising, given the proximity of Silicon Valley, that the languages most likely to be heard at the viewpoint (this one's Glacier Point) are ...Indian! You can hear a little Hindi, and then, of course, the couple walk blithely between the camera and the view.

But then the camera zooms in on Half Dome and..you can see the rock climbers who have reached the top.

Here are some rock-climbers who have finished, and are drying out their equipment:

Here are the delightful Amstutz girls...Karen,Eliza,Sylvie and Lupin.... who gave me such a warm welcome to their home in El Portal!

Here's the wonderful Tioga Pass Resort (popularly called TPR) where we had a really superb lunch, and took some pie for the Amstutz girls...

Here's a rushing stream, and a notice that says what it's being used for...


<lj-embed id="60"/>


The implication seems to be, if it's NOT drinking water for humans, it's OK to contaminate it!


Isn't it lovely to hear the sound of rushing water?


The building with the signboard of Yosemite National Park:

Deeksha pointed out these lovely criss-crossing vapour trails as we approached San Jose on our return...

We went to as many destinations in Yosemite as humanly possible, in those packed two days; east to west, I discovered the park as I have always wanted to, including such areas as the Tioga Pass, which a friend recently told me he had never visited though he has been to Yosemite four times! 

This was a trip that I would rank with my visits to....the Pyramids, the Necropolis in Iran, the visit to Darjeeling when I saw Mount Everest at the age of twenty-one, the sighting of the tree-climbing lions in Tanzania's Lake Manyara....

Thank you, Y, thank you, K, you gave me great memories for a lifetime!
