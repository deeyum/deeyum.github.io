<P>

The emotions humans feel, the things that irritate, inspire, or amuse us, are all the same...why, then, do we have such a tower of Babel to express similar thoughts? Why did all language not remain the same, much as our thoughts?</P><P>For example, we saw this lotus blooming in a large stone urn of water in Penang, in a Buddhist temple. We couldn't understand any of the writing on the temple walls...but the lotus needed no words.</P><P>And, I am sure, this beautiful photograph that my husband took, will speak to the hearts of many who read this.
