Walking down Malleswaram, I saw this strangely moving sight....it shows that our footpaths are put to far more uses than the BBMP envisions...

A man and a dog often share a home...but sharing a home on the pavement....and peacefully asleep together...the sight was odd, and eloquent of poverty in our city.
