Today's the day something nasty's to happen:
The clouds loom, and cover the sky:
We don't know why this happened to us..
There's no point asking why.

But we hope that the clouds will part
And the sunlight will come,dazzling, through...
Creating a rainbow in the same heavy clouds,
The happiness of the future will come into view...

That was the view from the aircraft, and that was the thought I had....
