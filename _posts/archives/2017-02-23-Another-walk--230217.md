Another walk from my daughter's home to mine. 
It's never the same...
this time:
my usual lane completely dug up by an excavator, with pedestrians inching along the trash-filled edges; 
boiled corn and peanuts being readied in pushcarts for the evening; 
lots of people sipping tea or filterkaapi at the darshinis; 
a young couple, completely engrossed in each other across the handlebars of the young man's scooter; 
an old lady peering up into a lime tree to see if she can pluck some fruit; 
a man cutting a blind boy's fingernails; 
an old man in a car looking sourly at the two-wheeler antics of the youth in front of him; maids returning home at the end of their working day; 
the ironing lady getting piles of clothes ready; 
jacaranda blossoms, and mahogany leaves, piling up and swirling at my feet in the breeze...
the walk just goes past in a flash.
