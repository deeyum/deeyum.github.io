Yesterday <lj user="sainath"> and I spotted these two birds:

The Golden Oriole...there were a few of these very beautiful birds flying around amongst the giant Eucalyptus trees; I have earlier seen them in a different area of the park, amongst the rain trees.

Apparently, another variety, the Black-Naped Oriole, has been sighted in Lalbagh too. I hope to be able to sight one soon....

And on one of the largest, oldest trees in Lalbagh, which is a variety of the Silk-Cotton, we found the Chestnut-Tailed Starling feeding:

Both were a delightful sight to see, and we spent far longer than we had planned, watching them.
