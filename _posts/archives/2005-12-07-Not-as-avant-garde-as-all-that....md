Went to a play being put up as part of the Bangalore Habba...it started out with an actor doing some form of slow-motion aerobics while shouting the dialogue a couple of words at a time as if he was in terrible pain...all the walking I had done today made me go to sleep for a few minutes. I woke up to see the same actor continuing his stomach-ache aerobics...my friend and I found several people walking out and quickly followed suit.

I love theatre....but I am old-fashioned enough to want an actual plot with actual action...this is too modern for me!

I wanted to go to a play by one of my favourite theatre groups, Rafiki, yesterday...my spouse invited some guests home and the theatre evaporated in a whiff of smoke from the pots and pans in the kitchen!
