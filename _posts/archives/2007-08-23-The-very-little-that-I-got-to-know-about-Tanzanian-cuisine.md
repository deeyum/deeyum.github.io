Well, having posted all that, I decided that though I never got a chance to eat in a Tanzanian home, I must set down the little that I learnt about food in Tanzania.

I might be mistaken, so do correct me if you have more accurate knowledge.

Apparently the staple food is maize/corn, and from maize/corn flour they make a kind of sticky pasty preparation called Ugali. This is just the flour, cooked in water with salt.

They also have a stew to go with it which is called Achali.

Apart from this, I was told about two dishes by the chef at one of the hotels:

"Kuku was Kupaka", which is stewed chicken simmered in coconut, and served with Ugaii and Achali

and


"Nyama ya Kukaanga" whihc is marinated beef flakes, again served with Ugali and Achali.

I was rather surprised when Huruma told me that tamarind is not used in the local cuisine, or the vegetable "drumstick" (moringa), as both trees grow plentifully in the region.

That's the trouble with staying in hotels..you get the generic touristy food...

But I suppose, if the Masai's favourite drink is milk mixed with blood, one would be better off with mineral water!

<LJ user="thaths">....you say you know the region well...can you let me know something more about the cuisine?
