Some of the common birds are also the most colourful...here is the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Swamphen"> Purple Moorhen, also called the Purple Swamphen </a> , a frequent sight amongst the waterbodies in and around Bangalore:

We saw a lot of these birds when I took some of my friends on the Lalbagh walk. They walk around on the lily pads for all the world as it that was a stable footpath...but even for them, the pads do sometimes flip up:

Here you see a swamphen feeding on the lily stems..see how it uses its feet cleverly:

And invariably, arguments erupt as to who should get what...that's the way of the world! Here's a colourful fight going on, with the birds attacking beak and claw!

Want to come on the Lalbagh walk with me, now that you have seen these common, yet lovely birds?
