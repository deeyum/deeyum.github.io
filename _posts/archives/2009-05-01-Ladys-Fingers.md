I'll get the toes soon....

I love and admire my daughter; she went through unimaginable pain, both during,before, and after the birth....she's had to stay extra time in the hospital as a result. 

If men had to have babies, we'd have got it down to something like fishing by now...pleasurable, relaxed and painless...
