In Thattekkad, I was walking along (trailing well behind the others as usual)...when I saw this butterfly (Karthik tells me it is a LARGE YEOMAN) flitting past, and then ...a dramatic sudden death befell it.

The butterfly just flew into a web that I could not see, except for this single strand;it fluttered helplessly for a few seconds...and though I could not see that any spider had approached it or bitten it...it just went still, and hung there, suspended by that single strand.

I can't understand how the butterfly died without the spider biting it...can someone inform me about this?

On a philosophical note...I do hope this is the way I die...quick...without illness, without more than the least amount of suffering possible...
