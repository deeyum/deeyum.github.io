Another day, another picture of the Oriental Dwarf Kingfisher from one of the organized Shoot-the-Kingfisher tours with hundreds of likes. One of these tours has a rule that "members shall not move from the position assigned to them when shooting the kingfisher" ..or words to that effect. Charges are several thousand rupees from point X, which seems to be about 2 miles away from the bird's home.(You have to get to, and from, point X at your own cost.)  Each "Oh Dee Kay Eff" photo must cost lakhs, if you add the cost of the equipment. But, ofkose, all those likes are worth it!....Bird photography tourism at its best.
