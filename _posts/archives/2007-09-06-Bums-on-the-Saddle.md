That's the name of the online cycle shop set up by <LJ user="rohan_kini"> and his friend <LJ user="nikhile">...

I have been trying to get to see Pavitra Jayaraman on NDTV. She's special to me for a reason....so I switched on NDTV just now (it's not usual for me to watch TV at this time).

And...I watched (most of) a segment that Pavitra did, about <a href="http://www.bumsonthesaddle.com"> Bums on the Saddle </a>. But in the part I saw, only Nikhil was shown, so I *still* don't know what Rohan looks like! I am very impressed with these people who, on a sustained basis, cycle to work every day.

I am happy that I saw a report by Pavitra, even though her face wasn't seen. And I am glad that Bums on the Saddle was featured! Wayyyy to gooo, Nikhil and Rohan, and others of your ilk.
