I am enjoying the lovely weather in Bangalore...winter has set in....went out somewhere and relished a&nbsp; tiny samosa from Shenoy Stores&nbsp;and a TTT ( Tiny Thimble Tea...you get it for Rs.2, yes, I&nbsp; kid you not, at Spoorthy Enterprises in 4th block and some other places like that)....I love these tiny snacks, which are not large enough to do any harm and yet hit the spot...
