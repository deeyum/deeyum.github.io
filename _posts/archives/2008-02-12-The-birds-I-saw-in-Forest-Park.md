Non-birders, s.k.i.p!

The birds do include some birds in captivity on the Zoo lake (apparently, they CAN fly away if they want to...but they don't, as they get regular food here! Does that remind you of  grown children who live with their parents? Well, that's the culture in India...)

But first, let me list the local birds...

Here are two views of the SONG SPARROW:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248037039/" title="song sparrow, Forest Park 020208 by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2176/2248037039_3afc50e686_o.jpg" width="450" height="480" alt="song sparrow, Forest Park 020208" /></a>


and its front view:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248038259/" title="another view of song sparrow by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2344/2248038259_0835aae654_o.jpg" width="404" height="480" alt="another view of song sparrow" /></a>

<lj-cut text="more birds">


This is the Northern Mockingbird, that I have posted about earlier, too. It's a frequently seen bird:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248839340/" title="northern mockingbird enright ave by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2045/2248839340_73cb358939_o.jpg" width="397" height="480" alt="northern mockingbird enright ave" /></a>


And here's a RED-TAILED HAWK, sitting high up and saying, quite clearly and loudly, "Ha, ha, you don't have the Canon 20D or the 300mm lens, ha, ha..."



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249783723/" title="red-tailed hawk Forest Park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2038/2249783723_8aa35ae25c_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="red-tailed hawk Forest Park" /></a>


And when a shot like this on the S3 is zoomed, this is the kind of grainy result I get. Just look at the eyes of the bird looking directly at me.... if ONLY I had the 300mm lens!!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2258265503/" title="red-tailed hawk look forest park by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2161/2258265503_72fb1387b3_o.jpg" width="355" height="480" alt="red-tailed hawk look forest park" /></a>


Here's the RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2258293263/" title="red-shouldered blackbird forest park 100208 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2316/2258293263_de4c94e975_o.jpg" width="480" height="466" alt="red-shouldered blackbird forest park 100208" /></a>

This one seems to be the female, though I am not sure:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2258279197/" title="Red-Winged Blackbird (female?) Forest Park 100208 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2354/2258279197_8e81eb1481_o.jpg" width="480" height="419" alt="Red-Winged Blackbird (female?) Forest Park 100208" /></a>


I had to be swift to get this shot of this possible juvenile Red-Tail, as it winged past into some trees, but didn't get a good image:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2258280903/" title="kestrel in flight forest park 100208 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/2258280903_e1b4a5e3d7_o.jpg" width="480" height="415" alt="kestrel in flight forest park 100208" /></a>

I went to where I thought I could see some DOWNY-HEADED WOODPECKERS, but all I got to see were what I *think* are woodpecker-made holes...





<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2250048141/" title="woodpecker-made holes? forest park 070208 by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2330/2250048141_eef4dcb428_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="woodpecker-made holes? forest park 070208" /></a>





Then there are the birds on the various water bodies in Forest Park...I spent most of my time at Jefferson Lake:

The most common (and yet beautiful) one, the MALLARD...those curly tail-feathers are typical:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2259057366/" title="mallard forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2177/2259057366_aa6e222899_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="mallard forest park" /></a>


Here's the ROSY-BILLED POCHARD:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248056433/" title="rosy-billed pochard forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2343/2248056433_0f8e98a35c_o.jpg" width="480" height="309" alt="rosy-billed pochard forest park" /></a>


A couple of RED-CRESTED POCHARDS:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249777863/" title="red-crested pochards forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2097/2249777863_b081fd3c74_o.jpg" width="480" height="346" alt="red-crested pochards forest park" /></a>


This one is the CHILOE WIGEON:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23605368@N06/2259060840/" title="chiloe wigeon forest park by feb8onwards, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2259060840_c50bffbcbe_o.jpg" width="480" height="363" alt="chiloe wigeon forest park" /></a>



I don't know if this is a variety of MALLARD, or one of the CHILOE WIGEON:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250579242/" title="mallard variety  zoo lake by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2316/2250579242_2262b6e828_o.jpg" width="480" height="410" alt="mallard variety  zoo lake" /></a>

 This, I think, is a GADWALL, a very common duck:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250588290/" title="gadwall by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/2250588290_639a289083_o.jpg" width="480" height="174" alt="gadwall" /></a>


Here's a CANADA GOOSE doing a...what else?...goose-step:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248041279/" title="canada goose forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2062/2248041279_21e8f72cf9_o.jpg" width="479" height="322" alt="canada goose forest park" /></a>

Though the birds are indeed wild, they are very used to human beings...here's one giving me a look as if to say, "Are you going to feed me, or just keep on clicking pictures?"


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250573362/" title="canada goose gives me that look! by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/2250573362_b88eac5502_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="canada goose gives me that look!" /></a>


I think this one is an AUSTRALIAN SHELDUCK, though I am not completely sure...if anyone knows, do id it properly!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248836850/" title="australian shelduck? forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2166/2248836850_d6c6f15fa6_o.jpg" width="418" height="480" alt="australian shelduck? forest park" /></a>

If that one's an Australian Shelduck, what's this one? If this is it, what's the one above? Dunno...


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250567986/" title="australian shelduck forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2059/2250567986_b1398899bb_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="australian shelduck forest park" /></a>


This one's a HOODED MERGANSER:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250572664/" title="Hooded Merganser Forest Park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2019/2250572664_9f8d61f7cf_o.jpg" width="480" height="460" alt="Hooded Merganser Forest Park" /></a>

This BAR-HEADED GOOSE was one of a few on the lake; one seemed to have a ring but was too far for me to look properly:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2250577378/" title="bar-headed goose forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2191/2250577378_c7be571793_o.jpg" width="480" height="405" alt="bar-headed goose forest park" /></a>


These AMERICAN WOOD DUCKS really look like brightly-painted toys; I spotted them in the far distance one day, which explains this grainy shot. I never found them at that place on my subsequent visits, alas:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249065340/" title="wood ducks forest park by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/2249065340_59d2798447_o.jpg" width="324" height="269" alt="wood ducks forest park" /></a>


<LJ user="yathin"> id'd this one for me as the female COMMON MERGANSER:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249055691/" title="female common merganser by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2073/2249055691_975bac768d_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="female common merganser" /></a>


And here's another one, indulging in a most self-absorbed scratch in mid-water!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249853214/" title="duck scratch! by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2064/2249853214_085ac026e3_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="duck scratch!" /></a>



These BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT HERONS are very similar to the herons we have in India:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248834086/" title="black-crowned night heron s( winter migrants) by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2012/2248834086_0d93b81d45_o.jpg" width="479" height="311" alt="black-crowned night heron s( winter migrants)" /></a>


Just when I thought I was getting my geese, swans, and ducks in order, along came this SWAN GOOSE to confuse me again!


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249781327/" title="swan goose st louis zoo lake by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2153/2249781327_4419de6184_o.jpg" width="367" height="479" alt="swan goose st louis zoo lake" /></a>


A few of the birds have been brought in by the Zoo, and are neither captive nor wild, such as this BLACK SWAN:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249845406/" title="black swan by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/2249845406_f004c576e2_o.jpg" width="480" height="408" alt="black swan" /></a>


And this BLACK-NECKED SWAN:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2249783649/" title="black-necked swan zoo lake by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2364/2249783649_c8890b382b_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="black-necked swan zoo lake" /></a>



The term "Feeding Time at the Zoo" has become a very metaphorical phrase, so here, for a change, it is, with quite the literal meaning! These American Pelicans can, apparently, fly away if they want to, but they stay put at the Zoo Lake:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248850456/" title="quite literally, feeding time at the Zoo! by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2010/2248850456_e32fc5ef8d_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="quite literally, feeding time at the Zoo!" /></a>


Here they are, having a good old gossip as they wait for food (they congregate at one part of the lake shore  by about 4pm, I think they know that food comes regularly at that time!)



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2248834170/" title="a conference of pelicans.... by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/2248834170_5726210a63_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="a conference of pelicans...." /></a>



The pelicans look like venerable old men with their snowy crests and the wrinkles around their eyes:

</lj-cut>

I close with this shot that I call "Black and White":
