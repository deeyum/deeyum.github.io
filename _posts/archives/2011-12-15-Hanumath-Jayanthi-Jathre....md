I am in a tearing hurry to catch the train to go to Kumarakom, Kerala, to attend KM's annual IIMA class gathering...but for my niece and daughter, I've uploaded photos of the Jathre (fair) for Hanumath Jayanthi (birthday of the Monkey God)...

I've set it as "public", so I hope everyone can see the photos!
