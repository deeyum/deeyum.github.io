We had been to the  Rembrandt etchings/woodcut exhibition at the <a href="http://www.stlouis.art.museum/"> Art Museum at St Louis </a>...again, just a 40-minute walk from home....and  his command of line and light and shadow, detail and perspective, was just stunning.

Here's his quickly-sketched self-portrait...

We were not allowed to photograph several pictures because they were from private collections.
