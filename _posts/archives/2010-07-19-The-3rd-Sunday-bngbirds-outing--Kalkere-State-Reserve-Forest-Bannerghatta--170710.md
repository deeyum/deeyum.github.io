As Sesh mentioned (already!) on Facebook, it was a record turnout for the 3rd Sunday bngbirds outing, at Kalkere, on Bannerghatta Road. I thought we might be 70, but Sesh's tally was 120!

The walk also lasted much longer than any bngbirds outing I've ever been to...we broke up only past noon, I think!

Here's our starting point, the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests:

Let me start with a very big thank  you to Geetanjali and Subir Dhar, who've been tirelessly promoting nature trails  and birdwalks for everyone, in the Bannerghatta area:

and to the Forest Guards, of whom I was able to photograph Kuppiah and Shankar:

<lj-cut text=" OK...now for the outing and the various curious things">


Here are a few of us, gathered together, trying to look at dim shapes in the dim light that the experts assured us were warblers and sunbirds:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7620.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7620.jpg" border="0" alt="bngbirds members 170710 kalkere"></a>

I decided to take a panning shot of our group, which was one of four before we all finally met up:



<lj-embed id="371"/>

and here's Subbu, with binocs, and his knowledge... ready to share both  with anyone who asked!



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7624.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7624.jpg" border="0" alt="170710 subbu"></a>



here's just one shot of the beautiful scenery that we walked through:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7607.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7607.jpg" border="0" alt="scenery rock pools 170710"></a>


I woud call this a nature ramble, rathen than a birdwalk, as we certainly didn't see too many birds (as Sesh said, more birders than birds!)...and the only two I managed to snap were this beautiful (though moulting)

SHORT-TOED SNAKE EAGLE


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7700.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7700.jpg" border="0" alt="short-toed snake eagle 170710"></a>



(I must add that many experienced birders have the habit of shortening the name and just saying "Short-toed!" when they see the bird, giving the impression to newbies that there is a short toad flying in the sky.)

This 

SMALL GREEN BARBET

was sitting rather far away, but was at least photographable in the grey, dim light...


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7618.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7618.jpg" border="0" alt="barbet 170710"></a>

Could someone put up the birdlist, please? We did see several Red-Wattled Lapwings, Warblers, Sunbirds, and Flowerpeckers,  an Eurasian Eagle Owl, a Blue-faced Malkoha, a pair of Grey Francolins, and perhaps others saw more birds....


But the "various curious" things that I mentioned were numerous, and fascinating. We started with the common

CHELORODENDRUM flowers:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7608.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7608.jpg" border="0" alt="cholordendrum sp. 170710"></a>

MBK pointed out the

ASPARAGUS plant....(I didn't know this is the origin of the asparagus on my table!)

and Karthik told me that the red leaf in the photo belongs to the 

INDIAN SARASAPARILLA:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7614.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7614.jpg" border="0" alt="asparagus fern and indian sarasaparilla"></a>


I loved the red berries of this plant, with the dreadfully difficult scientific name of  Erythroxylon monogynum...but Karthik tells me it's called the

BASTARD SANDAL

as the plant has a scent similar to sandalwood:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7644.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7644.jpg" border="0" alt="bastard sandal"></a>


Subbu picked some of these delicious 

SCUTIA

berries for us, and told us how birds feast upon them (so did I!)


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7649.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7649.jpg" border="0" alt="scutia berries 170710"></a>

These bushes had beautiful flowers, but were also infected with 

GALL:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7673.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7673.jpg" border="0" alt="kalkere bush with gall"></a>

We had a discussion on the difference between thorns and prickles; these "wait a bit" prickles, explained Subbu, are curved backwards, so that they make you pause and "wait a bit" as you extricate yourself and your clothes from them!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7664.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7664.jpg" border="0" alt="wait a bit thorns 170710"></a>


MBK asked us to look at this flowering tree, but alas, I never found out what it was, hoping to be enlightened now!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7651.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7651.jpg" border="0" alt="un id flowering tree 170710"></a>


Karthik pointed out this beautiful

GROUND ORCHID:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7736-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7736-1.jpg" border="0" alt="ground orchid 170710"></a>

Update: Sangeeta Kadur tells me it is the Habenaria roxburghii (Thanks, S!)


Everywhere, these brilliant,tiny flowers (belonging to the Commelinacae family, Karthik tells me that they are the Cyanotis sp.) were blooming...I call them the Deepavali firecracker flower!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7709.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7709.jpg" border="0" alt="commelina sp. 170710"></a>


MBK explained some of the techniques of plant census and interpretation, with help from A K Raju,  at one of the rock pools (we also had a great time looking at the tadpoles and hoppers!)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7717.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7717.jpg" border="0" alt="plant census 170710"></a>


MBK showed us this fluid oozing through the rocks. It is emitted by a small creature called the Diatom... and it was amazing to think of the fact that such fluids are what, ultimately, are converted into petrol!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7727.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7727.jpg" border="0" alt="dation in rocks 170710"></a>

This was also a nostalgia trip for the experienced birders/naturalists amongst us. In the "good old days", experienced naturalists like Karthik, MBK and Subbu would walk along the path and this 

HANUMAN STONE 

was a landmark for them:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7636.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7636.jpg" border="0" alt="hanuman stone kalkere 170710"></a>


We found this piece of 

QUARTZ,


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7690.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7690.jpg" border="0" alt="mbk holding quartz"></a>

which this gemmologist (do give your name!) identified:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7691.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7691.jpg" border="0" alt="the gemmologist who id&#39;d the quartz"></a>

We had an interesting discussion about quartz and agate!

Even s*&t is interesting in Nature...these are the droppings of a

BLACK-NAPED HARE

(there are no "rabbits" in India, technically!)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7713.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7713.jpg" border="0" alt="black-naped hare droppings"></a>


But by far the most interesting things on the outing was what I call "Life Under Foot"...the life that exists under foot, and is under a foot, and often under an inch, in size.

On a nearby plant, this

PLUM JUDY 

posed:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7677.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7677.jpg" border="0" alt="plum judy 170710"></a>

we were enchanted by the beauty of this 

GREEN LYNX SPIDER:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7682.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7682.jpg" border="0" alt="kalkere green lynx spider"></a>


Subbu showed us this pupa of the 

BAGWORM/CASEWORM:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7665.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7665.jpg" border="0" alt="bagworm/caseworm"></a>


We were also told that these 

HAIRY CATERPILLARS

were delicacies for the birds:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7663.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7663.jpg" border="0" alt="170710 hairy caterpillars"></a>

Subbu pointed out that very often, Sunbirds make their nests in the nests of

SOCIAL SPIDERS:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7660.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7660.jpg" border="0" alt="subbu near social spiders&#39; nest"></a>

We spotted this jewelled beauty, which Subbu id'd as a

CETONID BEETLE (Karthik says its common name is LEAF CHAFER):

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7657.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7657.jpg" border="0" alt="cetonid  bug 170710 kalkere"></a>

even the children were enchanted by the camouflage of the

STICK INSECT:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7646.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7646.jpg" border="0" alt="stick insect 170710"></a>

Here it is:

One of my fellow birders held this

MILLIPEDE

spiralling into itself, for me to photograph!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7643.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7643.jpg" border="0" alt="kalkere millipede 170710"></a>

Subbu took off the top of one of the living 

TERMITE NESTS

and showed us the structures inside:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7652.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7652.jpg" border="0" alt="termite nest top taken off 170710"></a>

he explained how the temperature was maintained at a constant level inside, and showed us the beautiful entrance channels:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7656.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7656.jpg" border="0" alt="termite nest top showing entrances 170710"></a>


He gave a delightful short dissertation on termites, the males, the queen, and the lifespan of such nests. 



We were entranced by this beautiful caterpillar, which Karthik tells me is that of the

BLUE TIGER butterfly:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7730.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7730.jpg" border="0" alt="blue mormon caterpillar170710"></a>

Another beauty was this

SIX-SPOT GROUND BEETLE:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7748.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7748.jpg" border="0" alt="six spot ground beetle 170710"></a>

Karthik cautioned us about the creatures powerful mandibles, which could deliver a painful bite, but Subbu expertly picked it up...and Karthik allowed me to take a pic of those mandibles, holding a twig!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7751.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7751.jpg" border="0" alt="beetle mandibles 170710"></a>

Uma showed me this pupal case of a

DRAGONFLY:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7723.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7723.jpg" border="0" alt="pupa case of dragonfly"></a>


At the end of the walk I suddenly found all the cameras out again..and realized we were walking into a "field" of 

GIANT WOOD SPIDERS:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7765.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7765.jpg" border="0" alt="photographing the wood spiders 170710"></a>


We had to walk carefully, to avoid walking into a web....I joked that this was the cyberspace area of Kalkere as there were so many websites.

Here's one:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7768.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7768.jpg" border="0" alt="giant wood spider 170710"></a>

We also found a lot of 

MUSHROOMS, ALGAE and FUNGUS 

on our ramble.

Here's Karthik taking his usual trouble (with some help from Raju!) to capture a mushroom:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7738.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7738.jpg" border="0" alt="SK capturing mushroom"></a>

Here's the mushroom, (it was so small, I could hardly see it!)



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7740.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7740.jpg" border="0" alt="karthik&#39;s mushroom"></a>


Karthik tapped open this

PUFFBALL MUSHROOM

and explained how it would propogate millions of spores:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7634.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7634.jpg" border="0" alt="puffball mushroom 170710"></a>

The moss formed bright and soft patches of brilliant green all over, and at the rock pool, MBK encouraged everyone to touch the algae in the pond and feel it.

I loved the beauty of the moss on this tree-trunk:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7758.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7758.jpg" border="0" alt="moss on treetrunk"></a>

As we were having chai right at the end of the ramble, I enjoyed the abstract pattern of the moss between the bricks, worthy of any painting!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7774.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7774.jpg" border="0" alt="moss among the bricks 170710"></a>

Meanwhile, Rohit Girotra has also put up a few photographs online...

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/rohitashwa18/BirdingOnBGRd?feat=email#"> here </a>

is the link to Rohit's photographs...thanks, Rohit!

If you see his pics, you'll realize just why the particular dragonfly he's photographed, is called the Granite Ghost!


</lj-cut>

It was amazing how each person spotted something different, and all of us benefited from the knowledge that our guides imparted to us. It was a most enjoyable way of learning!

Alas, I was too busy eating, when we all stopped for a variety of snacks during the walk...but my thanks to everyone who took care of the rumble in everyone's tummies, with a variety of goodies!

One of the highlights of the walk was Chandu (who, with a few of us, has been active in doing the Bannerghatta birdwalks for the children of the area) calling from Boise, Idaho, to find out how the walk was going. Chandu, we missed you very, very much!


Though we had started out as separate groups, we all met up in the middle of the forest area, and it was a most enjoyable and pleasant morning. Some of us later had breakfast together at Adigas, where MBK, at Karthik's request, showed us his famous "sugar trick" (link sent on request!) and a few of us came over to my place where we looked at our photographs and teased each other a little more! 

</lj-cut>


Let me close with this image of MBK at the rock pool....which tells me that I must, er, reflect on all that I learnt on the outing, and process the information into knowledge.



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7724.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7724.jpg" border="0" alt="mbk reflection rock pool"></a>


Thank you, bngbirds, for a very informative, educational, and fun-filled outing to Kalkere. I now have three mottoes....ASK (Ask S. Karthikeyan), KKP (Krishna Ko Pakdo), and SSP (Subbu Se Poocho)....to increase my knowledge about Nature!
