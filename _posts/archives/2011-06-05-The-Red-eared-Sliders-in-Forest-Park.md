It was almost exactly a year ago that I posted about 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/676509.html"> these beautiful turtles </a>

in Forest Park,

and precisely on the same date (what a coincidence!) I went for a 3 hour stroll around the park, and came back with 

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150199224978878.320967.587058877"> these pictures on Facebook </a>

....to share with my non-Facebook friends, here's one of the Red-eared Sliders:

I just learnt that Photobucket is now giving unlimited space...so that's great news for me! (though it is still more painful to post there, give the caption, take the URL, post it on LJ and add the narrative...than it is to quickly post the hi-res pics on Facebook and add the text!)
