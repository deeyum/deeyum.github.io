Some time ago (well, in 2009, as a matter of fact) I'd posted about the


<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/530258.html"> thooLi </a>



that the proud parents engineered for KTB (or Eli as she was then called...I'd forgotten that myself!)


When we went walking in Luz, in Mylapore, a few days ago, I snapped this thooLi hanging from the tree:

No engineering here, only cost-effectiveness; an old saree and the bough of a tree made a good place for the baby to be rocked to sleep.

I wonder, in how many cultures, this is a common way of putting babies to sleep?
