A comment from <LJ user="avinash_kj"> about barn owl being actually beautiful birds set me thinking...

So often, good-looking people are less than good, and good people are less than good-looking...

I recollect a Jane Austen sentence to the effect that "so often in this world, some people have goodness while others have all the appearance of it".


Here's a blurry pic that I took quickly out of a moving car, but I have kept it because it states a profound truth. 


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14175484@N04/1756586366/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2202/1756586366_b65e527360_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="good looks get you everywhere" /></a>

Look at the line in blue...Good looks get you everywhere, it says through the blur

It's not only because the picture is so blurry that it brings tears to my eyes! We keep *saying* that looks don't matter...but how often do we find the good-looking applicant being favoured over the others for a job, the better-looking baby being adopted...?
