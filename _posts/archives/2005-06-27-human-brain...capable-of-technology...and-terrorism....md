Spoke to my daughter on Yahoo Messenger...she was speaking to her husband on the telephone....Imagine hearing the voice of someone in Israel through a telephone line to the U S and thence through a net connection to India...incredible technology! Amazing...but not as amazing as the fact that the same human brain which can bring this about also is capable of thoughts of child rape, terrorism and shocking violence....
