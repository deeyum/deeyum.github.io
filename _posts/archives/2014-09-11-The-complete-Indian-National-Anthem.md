Though not greatly impressed by the self-conscious "I am a star singing" rendition of the singers...it's still a very beautiful poem, and very rarely does one hear all the stanzas sung (just like many other national anthems, I suspect!)

The translation is very good, too.

Now, if we could translated the emotion of pride that we feel into less corruption, lesser litter,  less unkindness towards our fellow citizens(and less apathetic acceptance of all these)....that would make for a better India.
