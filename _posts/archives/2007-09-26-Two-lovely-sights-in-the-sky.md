Yesterday, a few of us who write for Metroblogs were interviewed by Channel V for a program they are shooting across 8 cities.

Of course I took my little camera along...but apart from the very interesting evening, I saw what I call the smallest rainbow:

And within a few minutes, the nearly full moon was scudding through the clouds...

I am still feeling miserable for many reasons, but sights such as these really lift my spirits...the best things in life ARE sometimes free!

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the other Metrobloggers, and will be writing about Janet, who plants trees for free...thought of <LJ user="rohan_kini"> when I met her.
