This morning, <lj user="chaibacca"> emailed me, saying they had all thought of me when they saw this on the tree of their front lawn:

I usually drive down to Alton, Illinois, to see this most majestic of American raptors (and the iconic one!) when I visit St.Louis.

And....birders all over will smile to see what was mobbing the bird....

Apparently, crows are "mobsters" the world over!


Phots by Derek Shaffer.

DS' mother, L, told me on the phone that someone she met was waxing eloquent about how they'd had a great sighting of the Bald Eagle, and it was all she could do not to mention that they had visit from the bird, right at home!

The Shaffers also have a bird feeder that their work counter in the kitchen looks out on....and all sorts of birds, Cardinals, Nuthatches, and Chickadees, come and visit (of course, the last time I saw it, I was not an avid birdwatcher!)
