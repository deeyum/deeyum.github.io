The Kulgi Camp run by the Forest Department had this sign over the canteen (every tent  was named after a bird or animal)...

Why did I get the feeling that there would not be no tablecloth, candles or crystal?


The forest dept signs in Karnataka all have this blue-green diagonal background, which makes them easy to identify.
