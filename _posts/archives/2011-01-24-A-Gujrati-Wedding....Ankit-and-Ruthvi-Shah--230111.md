We've been spending a lot of time at a neighbour's wedding festivities.

I don't know much about Gujrati wedding rituals, but I enjoyed the colour and the pomp and the glitz....for the most part.

Here are the father and the younger brother (they all live on the same floor and same block as we do)

Here's the mother:

And here, taken through the windshield of the car, is the bridegroom himself, apparently communing with  himself for a moment before stepping out:

Of course, the dresses were way beyond grand...here's the detail from one saree blouse:

And the detail from the embroidery on another:

I'd have liked to have photographed some of the over-the-top jewellery...but that would have to be photography-in-people's faces, and I couldn't do it.

Here's the token dOli (bridal palanquin)...the bride would not have fitted into it unless she was a doll!

Here's a carved watermelon from the evening buffet multicuisine dinner:

Here's a video of the barAth (procession of the groom to the bride's home)

for the photos...this was only the wedding proper, this evening; I didn't take my camera along the past two days :)

The amount of food wasted, and the amount of plastic cups and spoons and theromocole plates used...marred my enjoyment of the wedding...so did the pain from my sprained ankle!
