Is that a dead cat?
No, no, not that!
It's a cat that's at ease:
It's a cat with the cream...AND the cheese;
On the grass, with eyes closed
Stretched out and unfurled:
Not bothered, not posed
Not a care in the world...

I wish I could put by
All my worries this way
And be the picture of contentment
Let the world go its way!
