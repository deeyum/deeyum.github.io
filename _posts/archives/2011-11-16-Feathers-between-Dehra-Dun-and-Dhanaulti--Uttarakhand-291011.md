Firstly, I must mention that going by all the signboards in this small town, we were visiting....U.K., which is the way the state, Uttara Khand (northern area) is referred to. Well....

This is dedicated to my dear friend 

<a href="http://toroid.org/ams/birds">AMS </a>

unfailingly helpful in my stumbling, forgetful path of birding....

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanaulti"> here </a>

is the wiki about the town of Dhanaulti...but the following photographs were all taken on the drive to, and from, Dhanaulti and Dehra Dun.

One of the most common birds was the

HIMALAYAN BULBUL:

<lj-cut text="more feathered friends">


another was the 

GREAT BARBET:

The

BLACK BULBUL

often showed itself, and fittingly, I took a silhouette shot!

Not so common, the 

CHESTNUT-BELLIED ROCK THRUSH

did not give me any good view of the more colourful male:

But I got a nice one of the female:

I also managed one of the

BLACK-LORED TIT

(that is also found in Bangalore!)

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9065.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9065.jpg" border="0" alt="blk lrd tit L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

At Buranskhand, we saw a lot of these little

YELLOW-FRONTED GREENFINCHES:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9149.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9149.jpg" border="0" alt="ylw frntd gnfinch L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

Everywhere, there were 

STREAKED LAUGHING THRUSHES

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9158.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9158.jpg" border="0" alt="strkd Lgng thrsh  L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

But never in the light!

At one point, we saw some exquisite

LONG-TAILED MINIVETS:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9189-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9189-1.jpg" border="0" alt="lng tled mnvet L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

and at several places, I saw the

RUFOUS SIBIA

However, the raptors were what took our breath away, as they soared high over the slopes. Here are a couple of shots of the

HIMALAYAN GRIFFON:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9242-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9242-1.jpg" border="0" alt="hmlyngrfn L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

I got just one shot of the 

STEPPE EAGLE  winging its way over the crags:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9240-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9240-3.jpg" border="0" alt="stp egl slp L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>



the 

LAMMERGEIER VULTURE

swooped close once or twice when we were not ready...but then, it was high up again, gaining height within a matter of seconds!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9235-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9235-1.jpg" border="0" alt="lmrgr closer L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

But my favourite was  that great beauty of the sub-Himalayan crags, the

MOUNTAIN HAWK EAGLE:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9225.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9225.jpg" border="0" alt="mtn hw egl  up L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>

I'll  say bye for now with one more shot of this majestic bird:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9224-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9224-2.jpg" border="0" alt="mtn hw egl side L dhnlti 303 291011"></a>
