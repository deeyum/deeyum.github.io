I was looking for the amenities available to passenger in various Indian railway stations, and just could not find anything that told me what was available, especially in the way of staying at the station itself. I posted on FB, and promptly got a lot of excellent links from friends.

I had overlooked the key words....in India, stations have "Retiring Rooms" (where one can get tired all over again? On the contrary, many of them are well-maintained...and hardly used!)

So...I am giving here the link that I got from helpful friends...thanks, Sharbari Lahiri (from Canada!), Sridhar Parthasarathy, and Rama Warrier.

and I hope it comes in handy for me one day soon!
