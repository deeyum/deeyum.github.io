.....

Watching something I had taped on Animal Planet, and there was a clip from Discovery, showing the plane hitting the second tower of WTC....I paused the frame, and wished intensely that the plane could have been frozen this way...I know that there have been far, far greater terror strikes, but the evil maniacal genius of this plan, combining the vulnerability of both aircraft and building, making sure that it got maximum visual publicity, too, still takes my breath away.

A salute to everyone, everywhere, who died as a result of terrorists' actions.
