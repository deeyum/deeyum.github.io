In today's world, there are umpteen ways and means of storing information. But...that remains information. When information is collated and synthesized into knowledge...it has to be stored in the original memory bank...between the two ears. Information is what you can access; knowledge is what you truly have.

And...another person's knowledge is still information to me.

This was brought about by the burgeoning amounts of information I get as I try to identify many of the creations of Nature--flowers, insects, birds, mammals. So many names, so many varieties, so many species. No matter where and how I store the information, what is going to be of use to me is always going to be what I can refer to in my head when I see something! So the sooner I process information into knowledge, the better it will be.
