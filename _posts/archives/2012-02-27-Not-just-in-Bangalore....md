<br />I&#39;ve been thinking that this phenomenon was iconic to Bangalore....<br /><br /><a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/deponti/pic/00005bqw/"><img alt="" height="480" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/deponti/pic/00005bqw/s640x480" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; " width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />These are our &quot;autos&quot; ...auto-rickshaws, an inescapable, convenient, irritating, frustrating method of transport in our city.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(237, 239, 244); ">The guy at the back IS pushing the one in the front, sometimes to a fuel station, sometimes until the auto in front starts its engine with the momentum. The foot is then withdrawn. I have never seen by what form of signalling the auto guy in front requests the help of the auto guy at the back...ESP?<br /><br />I posted this on Facebook, and I now realize that every Indian city seems to have this great &quot;auto-foot assist&quot; method of aiding movement!</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
