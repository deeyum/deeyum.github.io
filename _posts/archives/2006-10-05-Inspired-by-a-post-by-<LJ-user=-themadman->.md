Unusual Indians, culinary-wise:

&nbsp;Iyengars who don't like filter coffee
 Gujjus who don't like bhel puri
 Bengalis who don't like fish
 Tambrams who don't like curd rice
 Kashmiris who don't like kahva
Punjabis who don't like sarson ka saag
Malayalis &nbsp;who don't like tea (chaaya to be precise)

I know at least one person in each of the above categories....
