I thought D was kidding when he read it out, but no...it was really there in the tax form...

"If line 38 is $125,100 or less and you did not provide housing to a Midwestern displaced individual, multiply $3.650 by the number on line 6d."

Well, the rest of it is quite as funny, too...read no. 43...they have to *tell* you to enter "0"...

I told them that they had provided housing to a Far Eastern misplaced individual, so would they get a rebate on their taxes? Or could they at least get to multiply $ 8974 by the number on line 18f? (Big thrill of the day!)
