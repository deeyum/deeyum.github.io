No, I am not talking about long lines of passengers taking off their shoes as if they were visiting a temple, shedding mobile phones and cash and laptops and jackets. I am referring to the lines that this view from one of the airport corridors made:

The lines, long groups of them, along with the stars, in the display of the history of the American flag:

And the random lines that the hay forms, as this male House Sparrow "feathering his nest/has little time to rest/ as he gathers up his bits of twine and twig".....
