There are many of  what I call "algorithm songs" in old tamizh film music....and this beautiful, melodious song from 

"pArthAl pasi theerum" (hunger will be appeased with just a look)


<lj-embed id="870"/>


For the most of the song, the lines go, "Did X happen because of Y? Or did Y happen because of X?" with several things being X and Y...starting from the moving of the creeper and the arrival of the breeze.

I decided to google for the lyrics before posting a translation, and I got this hilarious link....

Superb job, wouldn't you say? I'm sure, "nfhb mire;jJk" explains it all very well!

Oh well, here goes the transliteration and translation of the lyrics....

Woman:

kodi ashainthathum kAtru vanthathA? kAtru vanthathum kodi ashainthathA?

Man:

nilavu vanthathum malar malarnthathA? malar malarnthathAl nilavu vanthathA?

Woman:

Woman:

kaN thiranthathum kAtchi vanthathA? katchi vanthathum kaN thiranthathA?

Man:

paruvam vanthathum Asai vanthathA? Asai vanthathum paruvam vanthathA?

(kodi)


Woman:

Man:

(kodi)

**************

Woman:

Did the breeze arrive when the creeper moved? Or did the creeper move when the breeze arrived?

Man:

Did the flower bloom when the moon arrive? Or did the moon arrive when the flower bloomed?

Woman:

Did the rhythm arrive when the song did? Or did the song arrive when the rhythm did?

Man:

Did the melody arrive when the emotion did? Or did the emotion arrive when the melody did?

Woman:

Did the scene arrive when the eyes opened? Or did the eyes opened when the scene arrived?

Man:

Did the desire arrive when the phase of life did? Or did the phase of life start when the desire did?

(kodi)

Woman:

Did the mouth open when the words came? Or did the words come when the mouth opened?

Man:

Did the shyness come because of womanhood? Or did the womanhood happen because of the shyness?

Woman:

The running to me, the searching for me, the singing to me, and the coming to see me....

Man:

Should it be called love? or affection? or mercy? or taking a liberty?

(kodi)

The melody is delightful, but the lyrics, while sounding sweet, are like gossamer and don't convey much.

Another "algorithm" song is "kaNNukku mai azhagu"....

"A" is the beauty of "B"....that  is the algorithm here :)
