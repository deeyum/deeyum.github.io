I went alone to Forest Park to see the launch of the balloons, and it was a trip well worth it, to see these colourful globes rising serenely and majestically into the cloudy,overcast, intermittently rainy sky. I'd been afraid that the wind would cross the 10-miles-an-hour limit beyond which the launch would be aborted, but it didn't happen....

is an account of the race by the St.Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper.

Here are a few balloons:

Some balloons were not to carry passengers!

Children had balloons in other shapes, too, here's SpongeBob SquarePants:

It was a great time for photographers:

And cyclists:

Some people, were, of course, on the job, and alert:

For a change, a Pepsi can was full of hot gas and not cold liquid:

It was funny watching it float past the Port-A-Potty line (mobile toilets!):

The Energizer Bunny and the Birthday Cake never got off the ground:

And ironically, American Airlines were firmly fixed to the ground, too! :)

(I would probably be the only one to go to a Balloon Race and take a video of the food stalls!)



A 180 degree view of the balloons, a few rising, and some already well away:

As I left the field, I  saw the  lovely sight of this little girl and her dog, amusing themselves:

A very enjoyable afternoon.....I have never seen such crowds in Forest Park, and what fun it was to walk back past the cars jammed into loooong lines, on the way home!
