Yes, I know I have plenty of Linkoping posts to catch up on, but a couple of days ago, PC and I had been to "Biltema", where he buys a lot of cycle stuff. I'd looked at a folding bike (with longing) and at the price tag (with revulsion...at 2190 SEK, the revulsion was strong!)

Yesterday evening, PC came back and said, "We are going to Marvin's place to buy his folding bike for you!" 

It appears that Marvin, a colleague and friend of PC's, is no longer able to cycle due to health issues. He is a dimunitive Indonesian, and so we went off to his place, hoping that the price tag would not be too high.

I fell in love with the cycle (I really don't cycle long distances, so I don't need a geared bike; with my fear of falling, often justified, I need a cycle where the saddle is low to the ground.) and PC pumped up the tyres for me, and I did a few rounds with a very gleeful expression on my face, thinking to myself, "Now don't grin like an ape, the price will go UP!" but quite, quite unable to stop doing so.

And my grin nearly met at the back of my head when PC told me that Marvin was quite keen to LEND me the bike, instead of selling it to me. I very nearly hugged and kissed the poor guy, and only stopped myself from doing so at the thought of the heart attack he might have.

PC got this picture of me on the cycle:

We came home, and PC has lent me one of his three helmets, and excuse me, I am off to Roxen Lake now! I'll get another pic of me with the helmet, all right and proper, this evening, when PC gets back from work.

Sweden is a DREAM for cyclists, with its dedicated cycle paths, perfect weather at this time of year, and wonderful green areas to cycle through. OOOOOH, how did I get so lucky! Thank you, <lj user="prashanthchengi">!

Update: now you can see me APH...All Properly Helmeted!

Alas, this morning, the vertigo that I suffer from (and which has attacked after a long gap) resulted in a fall, and cycling is off for at least a day or two....
