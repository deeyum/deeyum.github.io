The Loop is a lovely, lively area of St Louis,(well, technically, University City)..an area of shops and restaurants, within walking distance of Washington University (and more importantly, of DnA's home.)

They had a lovely Ice Carnival and it was that day that there was also a frost, and that added beauty to the Carnival.

There were a lot of ice sculptures on display, and it was a nice play on words to see a "snow" man made of...ice! Here we are, mother and daughter, with Mr Icy Cold (and that certainly described the weather, too!)

There was a young girl selling hot chocolate on the sidewalk but we made the mistake of waiting for our spouses to turn up (KM went to get the camera, and he took this picture)...and she had vanished when we went back looking for her.  So we went to a lovely restarant on the Loop called Blueberry Hill, and had lovely hot French onion soup instead...
