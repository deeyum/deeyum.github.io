I need Madhusmita ...or someone...to id all these butterflies, as I lost the piece of paper on which I had written some of  them down...


First, let me start with this wonderful incident. Little Tammy came into the Insectarium, and promptly, this butterfly landed on her finger, sending her into squeals of delight:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2224558746/" title="Butterfly at St Louis Zoo 270108 by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2240/2224558746_a605bcee5b_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Butterfly at St Louis Zoo 270108" /></a>

Here she is, with the St Louis Zoo volunteer behind her:

<lj-cut text="More pics for less than two clicks">

There is a big difference between these pics and the last lot of pics that I had posted...those were with KM's Canon 20D; these are with my Canon S3. Comments welcome, please!

Another view of the Paper Kite on Ixora flowers

A lovely butterfly with "scalloped" edges for wings, sitting on the lantana flowers which are such a weed in Bangalore: (I think it's the Indian Fritillary)


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231027584/" title="b'fly with fringed wing use by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2333/2231027584_c8b1c238fd_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="b'fly with fringed wing use" /></a>



Here's what I think is the Great Eggfly:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230237485/" title="great eggfly by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/2230237485_ef9420081d_o.jpg" width="480" height="352" alt="great eggfly" /></a>




This one I included as it looks so "butterfly-ey" but it's the dried seeds on a bush:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231023954/" title="dry leaves and seeds on tree by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2220/2231023954_d844d36fee_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="dry leaves and seeds on tree" /></a>


A bronze-black b'fly that I can't remember the id of:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231031572/" title="bronze-black b'fly by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2369/2231031572_fa5d5b6f06_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="bronze-black b'fly" /></a>


And one of this butterfly near the Hibiscus flowers:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2239682397/" title="bronze b'fly on hibiscus flowers by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2239682397_2259546362_o.jpg" width="411" height="403" alt="bronze b'fly on hibiscus flowers" /></a>


I would call this one the tiger, with the colour and the stripes, so of course, that is NOT what it would be called:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230241087/" title="tiger-striped long wing b'fly by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2401/2230241087_89e320f194_o.jpg" width="450" height="420" alt="tiger-striped long wing b'fly" /></a>


I think this is the Common Monarch:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230243911/" title="common monarch I think by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2230243911_085ff09011_o.jpg" width="480" height="441" alt="common monarch I think" /></a>

This one I remember, it's the Zebra Longwing:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230259133/" title="zebra longwing by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/2230259133_f81812146e_o.jpg" width="449" height="281" alt="zebra longwing" /></a>


This one is also orange and has four rings, wonder what it's called...Peacock Pansy?


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231052874/" title="orange four rings (?) by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2231052874_5c70a07a70_o.jpg" width="379" height="286" alt="orange four rings (?)" /></a>



Here's an old butterfly (has been in many battles and has half his wings torn off...it's a miracle that he is still able to fly around!....it's sitting on the Plumbago flower.


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231040414/" title="old b'fly on plumbago plant by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2268/2231040414_cb6811fff0_o.jpg" width="480" height="398" alt="old b'fly on plumbago plant" /></a>


And here's an Atlas Moth, one of the largest I have seen...


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231053060/" title="atlas moth (huge moth, just got out from pupa and dried its wings) by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2030/2231053060_158016cbf9_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="atlas moth (huge moth, just got out from pupa and dried its wings)" /></a>


Another bright copper-sulphate fronted b'fly, would like an id:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230239503/" title="copper sulphate wing b'fly by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2251/2230239503_1f1eb5105a_o.jpg" width="409" height="364" alt="copper sulphate wing b'fly" /></a>


I would call this a six-ring, of course, I would be wrong....



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230243839/" title="six ring bfly by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2144/2230243839_95ef2b968f_o.jpg" width="306" height="284" alt="six ring bfly" /></a>


And now for some flowers:

The Hibiscus:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231030702/" title="yellow hibiscus by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2287/2231030702_e3b1757542_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="yellow hibiscus" /></a>

Those were yellow; here's a regular red one,with the plumbago flowers in the background:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2240487640/" title="red hibiscus 260108 by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2138/2240487640_ac28038b13_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="red hibiscus 260108" /></a>





Here's the sun shining through a lovely pinkish one:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230250933/" title="hibiscus flower by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2230250933_67966014be_o.jpg" width="480" height="335" alt="hibiscus flower" /></a>




Some un id wildflower with a lovely pink complex inflorescence:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2230238621/" title="pink screwpine type flower by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2168/2230238621_511a769076_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="pink screwpine type flower" /></a>

You can see the Ixora flowers that the Paper Kite above is sitting on..

And here's an un id purple lily-like flower:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2231044250/" title="un id pink wildflower by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2235/2231044250_b6d79a7d8c_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="un id pink wildflower" /></a>


And some wildflower outside, flowering on the sere winter branches:

Here's another flower that I call the Mango-and-Vanilla flower:



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2239640263/" title="orange ice cream flower by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2416/2239640263_eaeca53000_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="orange ice cream flower" /></a>

I am closing with this ornamental plant that looks like a flower itself:
