I went and met Danny Brown in Forest Park, and spent a contented morning. There were no new birds, but I was trying out shots in different light settings. 

The early morning sunshine was something I had to get from Danny's running car:

The rising sun on the Cooper's Hawk gave me another opportunity to shoot against the sun:

<lj-cut text="a few more shots at different times of the day...">

This, to me, provided more drama than the conventional sunlight-on-the-bird shot.

There was the light on grass seeds:

The long shadows, and the arch of the bridge made an interesting composition:

I thought the sepia generalized the bird and accentuated the lines and curves.

The mist rising off the water made a good capture.

Even the common Mallard looked lovely in the golden light.

I enjoyed the various poses!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15361943615" title="IMG_1072 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3867/15361943615_bfa0d6f0ee_z.jpg" width="640" height="454" alt="IMG_1072"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15358766501" title="IMG_1082 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3844/15358766501_7b9f6dfc98_z.jpg" width="640" height="422" alt="IMG_1082"></a>

Greenery against the light was lovely, too.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15175184059" title="IMG_1066 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15175184059_0b06c3f627_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1066"></a>

Then we came across a Wood Duck couple, partially in the light, and partially out of it. This was quite a challenge, getting the birds and their reflections without too much of washout.

Getting details with the zoom was important.

Of course, Danny clicked away like the pro that he is; it was I who was struggling!

I got the male Wood Duck alone:

Getting macro shots against the morning light was also tough.

Another common bird, the Starling:

I got a Cormorant in mid-flight:

In the twilight, I went again to Forest Park, and got the Great Horned Owls that Mark and Brenda were showing some people:

I may not be producing earth-shaking shots, but I'm quite happy with my experiments with light at various times of the day.
