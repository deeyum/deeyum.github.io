My first birding outing of 2013....

<lj-cut text="if you want to read and see more...">

This morning, 11 of us went to the Valley School, off  Kanakapura Road...and as usual, the Valley did not disappoint us! After the MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop) while we were waiting for one of the two Nitins in our group, we proceeded to the Valley/Kanakapura Road junction, and began our birding. Yes, we concentrated on the birds.  I noted some butterflies in passing, that's all.

A Greater Coucal opened our innings, walking boldly along the newly-constructed crossroad. We were stopped in our tracks by two Palash (Flame of the Forest) trees in full bloom, which were, as usual, bird magnets. The road to the Valley also yielded Grey Francolins, scurrying off amidst the harvested fields, some Bushlarks fluttering  up into the sky to sing and fall back like autumn leaves....we finally managed to park and enter the campus, for which I had obtained permission.

Orioles, Flowerpeckers, Drongos, and a Hoopoe....we went on to the almost-dried-up pond, and found several waterfowl there. A juvenile Brahminy Kite (which we thought was a Honey Buzzard...we didn't notice the head carefully!)  fished in the water, as did two Ashy Drongos...drongo behaviour that I had not seen before. All this kept us at the pond, while the sun climbed...it's just not been feeling like a Bangalore winter at all.

The highlight of the day, perhaps, was a 

BLUE-BEARDED BEE-EATER:

but all the Flycatchers were a delight to watch, too. I was afraid that all the group could not see the first Tickell's Blue...but the birds, with their sweet song, obliged, and everyone got to see their beauty. The Fantails, the Asian Paradise, the Asian Brown....the bamboo grove is truly Flycatcher territory.

Reflection of Date Palms

At one point, we saw four Oriental Honey Buzzards soaring overhead, and I hope someone got the shot, because I was too busy just gaping upwards!

Installation with paper kites for a Mela in the Valley School in the afternoon.

As we ended the trail, Mr and Mrs Small Minivet, and Mr and Mrs Great Tit, obliged us by appearing the  Jacaranda trees near us.  I called it Sitting Birding...and mindful of the toilets near us, Vinay re-named it Smell Birding. We certainly weren't complaining, though.

We sighted a 

QUETZAL:

and a
