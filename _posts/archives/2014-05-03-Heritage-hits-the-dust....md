I went to Langford Town, and was saddened to see another beautiful heritage home hit the dust on Oleff road.

This lovely bungalow, typical of old Bangalore architecture, set in small, lovely garden, was already half gone.

I tried to see if the year of construction was marked anywhere, but could not find it.

The solidity of the construction, and the high ceilings, can be seen:

How I wish I had the money to buy up such old homes, and maintain them in the old style! I could sit in them and dream about days when space in the city was not such a valuable commodity,that history had to be sacrificed on the altar of Mammon...
