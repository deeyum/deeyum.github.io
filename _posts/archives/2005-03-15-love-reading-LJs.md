It's like being in a large gathering of friends..different viewpoints, different experiences....keeps me in touch with friends who are far away, and puts me in touch with new ones....lets me know what my child is currently undergoing, without needing long emails about it..I was content for a long time, to just read, but it is helping me a lot to have the daily discipline of writing, too!

some of my friends are

zweilinkfusse

oldhen

varshax

chaibacca

kalyan

fatmuttony

(hmmm..I don't know how to type so that their links appear onscreen...need a few lessons I guess!)
