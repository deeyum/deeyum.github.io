As I said
<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/456602.html"> earlier </a>,

 when jobless people have cameras in the kitchen....

they  rush to take pictures of bubbles (in a vessel in which milk was boiled)when their sons-in-law call their attention to them:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_4145.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_4145.jpg" border="0" alt="bubble in milk pathram 020809"></a>


Then the aforementioned son-in-law who ought to be rushing to work decides to have a little more finger-fun with that bubble,


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_4146.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_4146.jpg" border="0" alt="DS finger in bubble 020809"></a>

And aforementioned jobless people document that, too! :)

If you were looking for some sense in this post...well, I warned you!
