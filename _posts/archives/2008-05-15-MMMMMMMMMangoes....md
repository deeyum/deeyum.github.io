KM cheerfully looks forward to putting on a couple of kilos. at least, during the mango season. In fact I call it the "man go crazy about Alphonso" (or Alfonso) season...

So...here are a couple of them (they are always NOT cheap and I dither between eating them and locking them carefully in the safe)...

And when I tried photographing them with the flash, the colours changed:

The first two cartons were not very sweet, but now the taste is improving. Apparently, the unseasonal rains have caused a lot of damage and so the prices are high...or at least, that's the story THIS year!

I am fond of mangoes, but wouldn't die for them or without them...but KM, he says he merely *exists* until mango season, when he starts to live!
