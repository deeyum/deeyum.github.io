It's raining quite heavily as I sit, sleepless, typing....and the memories of the journey home unspools through my mind.... Bangalore's summer monsoon has begun, and it's 

<a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/graph/INXX0012#"> lovely balmy weather </a>

here right now!

I seem to have picked up (very unusually!) a bad sore throat and cough on the flight....but nuff said about that....the aerial photography is whatI want to write about!

Here's one of the complicated interchanges on the Atlanta highway that I got:

This is downtown Atlanta:

Rising fuel prices seem to have no impact at all on air traffic...my Bulgarian fellow-passenger and I counted FOURRTEEN aircraft (including ours)in the queue to take off!

Aha! Is this an attack on the Atlanta control tower a la 9/11?....no, it's only an insect on my cabin window, with the control tower in the background!

I opened the shades to find this wonderful sunset as we winged away from the US, towards Europe...

High above the earth, one does feel one is able to rise above the petty concerns of humanity....until one tries to make oneself comfortable in those

and realizes that small concerns don't go away at 30,000 feet above sea level!
