another forward that I got...


Good to know that Ram has got some land now. Because,
  SITA has been running a travel agency,
  Maruti is making cars,
  Laxman is being worshipped by cricket fans,
  Shatrughan is busy shaping his daughter's career,
  ...Bharat has started a petrol pump,
  Raavan is a commercial flop
  and there is peace in Lanka!
