Here's an email from Edge Wade of Missouri Birds:

Hi Deepa,

I've delayed writing you, waiting until your Forest Park Birders' Guide appears online.  It is now on the ASM site  

<a href="http://www.mobirds.org/BirdersGuides/1347.pdf"> here </a>


and will appear in the December Bluebird.  Thank you for this, and for your contributions to Missouri birding.

Cheers, 

Edge Wade
