Incredible, the way technology allowed us, sitting in the porch of a house in St Louis, to watch, live, the annual ceremony for my brother...we saw the puja, the food being served on plantain leaves, several of the guests stepped over and said hello, and they were able to see Eli, too....

How can the human mind, which has wrought such technology that's for the common good, also think of murder,terror, and other bestialities?
