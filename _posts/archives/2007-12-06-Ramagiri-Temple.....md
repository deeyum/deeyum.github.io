I ought to have gone peacefully to sleep; I have had a fairly busy day; but that hunting thing is still bothering me, so I am going to cheer myself up by posting a couple of pictures of the beautiful Ramagiri temple between Bangalore and Mysore.

Here are the dramatic rock formations in that area:

And here's one view of the temple:

If you click on either of the pictures, it will take you to the Flickr page, and you can see the other views of this extremely beautiful place.

And now I lay me down to sleep....!
