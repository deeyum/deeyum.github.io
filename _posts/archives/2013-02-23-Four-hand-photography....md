A sister and her brother
Are  joined by their mother
(Who belongs to a different land)
A father adds another
To this image of four hands!

DS asked for AM's hand in marriage, and he's always given a hand with the household chores, been a great handyman with mechanical repairs....I hope they always walk hand-in-hand through life, and I hope their life-tennis is full of forehand serves!
