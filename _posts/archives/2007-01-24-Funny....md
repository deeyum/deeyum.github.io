Whenever I tell an Indian-American that we are visiting our daughter and will be in the US for 6 weeks, the answer is, "such a short visit!" and when I say the same thing to an American-American (you know what I mean) the answer is, invariably, "a very long visit!" People may be the same everywhere...but this IS one cultural difference I have found!
