One reflection:


If there's some trait  I particularly detest in a person, I can be fairly sure that it's a trait that can be found in me, too...


Here's a photo of the mirror world of Creve Coeur Lake...the branches of the water world bend towards the branches of the air world. Do the bending branches admire themselves in the water, or do they look at other things? (Very <lj user="asakiyume">-ish thoughts!)

The mirror world clouds float along, matching their counterparts....that's synchronized scudding!

This is another kind of reflection.
