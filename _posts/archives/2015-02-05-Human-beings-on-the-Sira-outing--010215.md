We were a nice round dozen this time...

<lj-cut text="Do you want to see what the Yuman Beans were up to?">

And we went around Sira, along the edge of the lake

Some of us fanned out like the tree did, over our heads.

Some of us took local transportation on the very dusty road:

Some of us were pretty good with apps:

But at other times, wanted to drive our father's car!

Where we parked our cars, we watched preparations for the puja (ritual worship) at the temple opposite.

We also enjoyed seeing the open-air seating on the local buses:

We watched colourful buses plying.

This one was called McLaren...I wonder which race it would have won!

Some of us brought wonderful snacks (this is Ruma with chatpata sprouts!) that we shared:

We admired some of the local cyclists.

We exchanged notes..

We watched mantras flying by on mopeds.

Votive lamps for sale:

When watching birds we were all good fence!

Our food was very important, and here's lunch:

We watched the colourful buses:

Here's the local cinema hall.

A handmade door decoration:

Here we are at Kaggaladu village, gawking at the birds.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16430628001" title="IMG_0824 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8603/16430628001_97b3f5f1d2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0824"></a>

These ladies of Kaggaladu village are sorting out "avarekkALu" (the famous winter beans beloved by all in Karnataka)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16406408076" title="IMG_0827 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/16406408076_a9495b8a3e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0827"></a>

Here is little Navyashree, in her bright clothes.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16432385465" title="IMG_0828 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8627/16432385465_4a72086764_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0828"></a>

I wondered how the sheep (and the shepherd) found sustenance in the dry, parched area of Kaggaladu kere:

A child at her hip, and cattle to lead on...that's this woman's life...

The buffaloes weren't always co-operative!

Harish was doing PWUS... Photography With Unusual Supports.

(Have you heard of overhead cameras?)


We couldn't decide if Devadatha was a left-tea, or a right-tea!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15812458053" title="IMG_0925 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/15812458053_ec2dc8a00e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0925"></a>

Sajid had a "I've got great shots!" grin.

Others were still on the chain-link!

The local fishermen stopped their work and were watching our antics:

That was upright; this was Lying Photography.

It's very hard not to feel envious of someone who can relax like this!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16245123330" title="IMG_0976 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8592/16245123330_8583ce574b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0976"></a>

Our shadows lengthened across the water

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16246615157" title="IMG_0970 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8679/16246615157_55cd56c195_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_0970"></a>

And across the land.

Some people seemed to have shed their clothes...did they turn into spirits?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16430792161" title="IMG_1015 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7397/16430792161_d42c4e8740_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1015"></a>

I finally took a snap of the spoor of the Most Dangerous Animal.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16430790641" title="IMG_1014 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/16430790641_7185145b6b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1014"></a> 

There was a graphic reminder of what would happen to us if we didn't "Cross" the road carefully.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16244895178" title="IMG_1021 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/16244895178_f49d208a55_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1021"></a>

And here we are, at the end of a very happy day, tucking ourselves back into our cars for the journey home (via another Kamat Upachar, ofkose!)
