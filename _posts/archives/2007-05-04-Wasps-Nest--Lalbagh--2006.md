Sorry, I did promise not to post any more today, but this is at someone's special request, so here, MVR, is the wasps' nest that I photographed last year in Lalbagh. I do not seem to be able to find this photo on my earlier LJ posts....

It was in the low branches of a huge Ficus Benjamina tree.

This time I will tag it properly!
