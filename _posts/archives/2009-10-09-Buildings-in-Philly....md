Here's the view from my friends' home:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6987.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_6987.jpg" border="0" alt="view from madhu&#39;s window"></a>


One building had lights to illuminate the others:

<lj-cut text="here are some more">

Here's one building that belongs to the Jefferson Institute:

This one, near the Liberty Bell (more about that later) says, The Bourse, so it's the Stock Exchange:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7254.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7254.jpg" border="0" alt="the bourse"></a>

I was intrigued by the lighthouse tower on this house!

This is the historic 

<a href="http://www.valleygreeninn.com/"> Valley Green Inn </a>

(The wedding I went to attend was held here)


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7134.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7134.jpg" border="0" alt="valley green inn"></a>


This is the re-created long stable building, built with the same wooden joinery that the original was:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7132.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7132.jpg" border="0" alt="long stable bldg valley green inn"></a>


The 

<a href="http://www.philamuseum.org/"> Philadelphia Art Museum </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7082.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7082.jpg" border="0" alt="philly art museum 031009"></a>

I could never have guessed what this building was (in Flourtown)

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7119.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7119.jpg" border="0" alt="philly cricket club"></a>

It was the

<a href="http://www.philacricket.com/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp"> Cricket Club </a>, estd. 1854!

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7120.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7120.jpg" border="0" alt="philly cricket club signbd"></a>

I loved this narrow little old house:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7280.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7280.jpg" border="0" alt="narrow house"></a>

Another building that housed the 

<a href="http://www.hardrock.com/"> Hard Rock Cafe </a>

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7292.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7292.jpg" border="0" alt="hard rock cafe"></a>

Here are some of the buildings, including the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Hall"> City Hall </a>

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7291.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7291.jpg" border="0" alt="city hall and penn st"></a>

A more panoramic view of the buildings downtown:

Here's the Free Library, surely one of the greatest treasures for a Philadelphian:

And of course, the sight of the sun behind some of the skyscrapers was irresistible:
