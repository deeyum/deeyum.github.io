Many years ago, when I visited my cousin Harini, her young son Dushyant sang this song very sweetly:

I was entranced, and when KTB arrived, this was one of the songs I sang to her, too...it's one of her favourites now (who knows how long it will last?!)

When we went to Chicago and visited the Shedd Aquarium, I was delighted to see an actual baby Beluga whale, sporting in the water with its mother. I took some photos of the baby enjoying itself, playing with a toy, too...

To me, a baby anything is beautiful, but the sight of this baby Beluga with its toy starfish, swimming happily with its mother, will be a very happy memory.
