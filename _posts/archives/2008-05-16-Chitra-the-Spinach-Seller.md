When I wrote <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/380539.html"> my entry about  spinach </a>, I mentioned the young woman who came to my door several times a week to sell it.....

Here she is.

She is unfailingly cheerful. She has two children to support, and has a tough life. But that never affects her smile.

She asked me to take another photo of her when she would "dress up" and come! She's been coming to our apartment building for several years now. She says she sells all her vegetables in the complex and doesn't have to do the rounds of houses in this hot weather. All of us also give her something to eat or drink once in a while, or old clothes and books for her children.
