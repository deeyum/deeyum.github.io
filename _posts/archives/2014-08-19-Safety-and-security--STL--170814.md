Yesterday I went to

<a href="http://www.academyofsciencestl.org/calendar/functions/popup.php?ev=2456888&amp;readFile=0&amp;readSQL=1&amp;showCat=&amp;oc=1"> this event </a>

at the St.Louis Zoo auditorium.


I had not read in detail about the extinction of Passenger Pigeons in the US (where a population of several billion birds was wiped out, purely because of human intervention), and it was a revelation to me. 

However, I did not want to call on DnA to pick me up from the Zoo auditorium and I walked back. As I did, I mused on safety and security. There was nothing different about my walking back at about 9pm from the Zoo auditorium, across Forest Park, back home, I usually do it during Muny shows, Shakespeare-in-the-Park, or the Royal Philharmonic on Art Hill (it took me about half an hour, you can go to Google maps and look at the St.Louis Zoo, and look for Christ Deliverance Ministry, Enright Ave...you'll know where I walked) I usually cut across the grass, not always keeping to the roads. I was wondering, yesterday, if walking in the dark was a wise thing to do. Then I told myself that the fears were mostly in my own mind and perception...in fact, it was probably safer now than before the Ferguson incident,
(here's a video of John Oliver's take on it:

...actually, with so many police cars on the prowl ! I walked uneventfully back home. (It does help that I am a "black" person, not white, I suppose, in this area!)

So much of our fears are in our own perceptions, coloured by our own prejudices...where should we draw the line between genuine concerns and our own timorousness?

The trouble in the US is the stupid gun culture. I might be walking far away from any know source of trouble, and might get cut down by a stray bullet! Well, at the end of it all, I believe it's Fate...and I walk briskly, not loitering. And when I've got home safely, I like the feeling that I didn't give in to the feeling  of "Oh, what might happen to me!" and just call DnA to leave their hectic chores and come and pick me up!

But IF something had happened, I would have been reviled for my foolhardiness...how to know, in advance, if my fears are well-founded or groundless? No way, alas, but to put it to the test, and walk home!
