DnA drove off on Sunday, but KTB and I stayed on as we felt so comfortable with their warm hospitality.

<lj-cut text="Nithya did a lot of things for us, after DnA left with The Booda...">

She took us to the local library:

She baked a yummy zebra cake to celebrate Praveen's completing 12 years in his job:

She had two sous chefs who mainly helped by licking out the batter bowls!

She took us strawberry-picking:

I made puchkA, the Bengali version of pAni pUrI (and some other stuff that they liked to eat...I'm not an expert chef like Nithya, but I can make some "nostalgia" dishes!)

Antara and Nithya both suffered from strep throat and fever, but still managed to take very good care of us.

KTB made a nice thank you card:

We enjoyed our visit very much, and hope that Praveen, Nithya and Antara come to St.Louis soon, too!
