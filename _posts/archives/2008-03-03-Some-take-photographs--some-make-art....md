Here's  one of H S Ganesh's  (I know him only through his photos on INW) images...It was great to meet him on Sunday:

And just to show what art is, here is MY image of the Jungle Mynah:

Perfectly adequate and good. 

And right next to me stood Mahesh Devarajan, clicking the same Myna with the SAME combination (Canon 20D and Canon 300mm ...the only difference was, he had a teleconverter.)


and this is his image of that same bird:
