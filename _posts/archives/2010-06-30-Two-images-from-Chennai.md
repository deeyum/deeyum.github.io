One of the places that typifies Pondy Bazar, in Theagaraya Nagar (no one EVER calls it that, it's only referred to as T.Nagar! More about initial names for areas later)....is

...there's been a restaurant (in Tamil Nadu we call them "hotels") around on this spot for as long as I can remember.

<lj-cut text="more about Balaji Bhavan..and do you want the police on your doorstep?">

 The predecessor was called Shantha Bhavan (sorry, probably Sri Shantha Bhavan!)...and it changed hands and name, not because it didn't mint money for its owner...but (I was told) because that owner started financing movie productions, in 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodambakkam,_Chennai"> Kollywood, the Hollywood of Chennai </a>

and that's a surefire way to lose it all! So Shantha Bhavan became Balaji Bhavan, and the new owner apparently doesn't speculate, because Balaji Bhavan it remains, to this day...a very, very reasonable eatery where one usually goes while shopping in

Why IS Pondy Bazar called that? I don't know....after so many years of knowing, and living in, the area!

It's ironic that the Wiki says "it will require cleanup to Wiki standards"..Pondy Bazar itself can stand a LOT of cleaning...it's so congested and dirty now!

The other signboard I quickly captured out of a moving car illustrates the Chennai Police's efforts to put on a more friendly face, and be accessible to the general public...

(they are given a letter and a number...eg, D4 would be Mount Road(aNNA sAlai)

(the entry says, "R2 Police Station is one of the best Police Stations in Kodambakkam with good customer service.")

Interesting sidelight...in the rear-view mirror at the top left of the photo, you can see "Savi's Soups" in reverse!


However, I don't think I'd like the police on MY doorstep, thank you! I prefer not seeing certain parts of society, unless I *have* to.... like policemen, doctors, ambulance attendants, and insurance agents....
