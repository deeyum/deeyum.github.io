Celebrating one's patriotism is not a matter of flying the flag on one day...it also means not littering, not breaking the rules, being polite and helpful to other Indians...EVERY day. Pride in one's country should be a daily state of mind, not an occasional token statement. That minute of pride in the billowing Tiranga should extend into a lifetime of doing one's best for one's country.
