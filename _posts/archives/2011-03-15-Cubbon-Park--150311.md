<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubbon_Park"> Cubbon Park </a>

was just a short walk away for the first eight years of my life in Bangalore....and I was, of course, just a walker and a cyclist, never a birder or naturalist. And recently, having seen the bird species deplete almost before my eyes and Lalbagh, I have never felt that there could be a lot of varieties of birds in the Park.

When 

<a href="http://www.visualquotient.net/index.php/blog/"> Shreeram </a>

asked me if I'd like to go with him and Radha to document some of the flowering trees of Bangalore, I agreed, and never thought of birds at all.

But the birds gave us a surprise....I realize that familiarity must have bred contempt (and ignorance) as I never thought I'd see so many birds today. 

But the minute we stepped into the Park, a Spangled Drongo alighted on a Tabebuia argentea tree, and set off a bonus birding session....later, a mixed party of Ashy Drongos, Chestnut-tailed Starlings, added to by Spotted Doves, Rose-ringed Parakeets, and Common Mynahs, staged a spectacle that had us watching spellbound, our cameras switched off for the most part. 

I've posted my SMS  and account
