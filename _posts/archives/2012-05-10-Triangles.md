I loved the triangles that make up this image of the house opposite ours in St.Louis.....

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4494.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/IMG_4494.jpg" border="0" alt="frnt house flag r 090512 stl"></a>

And the following thoughts occurred to me, as well....



Triangles are a part of life.
They can be shapes of beauty.
But triangles can be a source of strife
When they interfere with duty!

In geometry or architecture,
All is good about triangles.
But (forgive me for the lecture)
In a marriage, they cause tangles!

A figure or a planned-out house
May have three dimensions;
But if caught in a triangle, a spouse
Can have, to trust, no pretensions!

A child is the only accepted way
There can be a marital triangle
And even then, the spouses can say
That the child is the smallest angle!

Three....a difficult number, and it makes me think.
