Here's the Mister:

and a couple of days ago, the less easily seen Mrs arrived at our doorstep, on the Japanese maple tree:

Does she or does she not, look like a toy bird!?

There's a small dip in the road, where a puddle forms after rain; the Robins, the Starlings, the Housefinches...they all drink from this water, and it's fascinating to watch them.

Housefinch update...both the nests are nearing completion, and "practice feeding" is going on between the male and the female...but I still don't see the female sitting in the nest for any length of time.
