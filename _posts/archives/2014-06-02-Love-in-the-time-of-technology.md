There was a time when palm leaves
And birds, too, were used
To communicate between lovers
And ensure that their souls fused.

The post and telegraph service
Improved this somewhat:
One could be in touch with the Other,
Heart could call to heart.

But now it is the techno-age,
The age of "keep-in-touch":
To keep separated and sundered hearts
From missing each other too much.

She can quietly text him;
Await his return SMS;
In the silence of words that fly
Their loneliness grows less.

Can she call him? Can he call her?
Can they exchange some words?
Can she hear him? Can he hear her?
Or--just static, screeching  birds?

It's said,by ancients, that love
Is conveyed through the eyes:
But if they're talking into a  phone
Depending on sight would not be wise.

Video calls, then, are the answer!
Of each other they can have their fill.
The thorny of the part of the rose will come
Along with the internet bill!
