Highlight of my morning!

<lj-cut text="A pleasant outing to the Valley and a lake..."> 


A quick decision made Amith

and me, decide not to go to Nandi Hills as per our original plan but to visit Valley School; the three of us set off in the pre-dawn darkness, and though birding was a bit slow as we drove down the road to the Valley, things picked up once we started walking along the periphery of the School wall.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15743060739" title="IMG_6324 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7544/15743060739_b21425794f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6324"></a>

It was delightful to walk along the familiar path after a long absence, and the bamboo groves certainly did not disappoint us! 

A new raptor added to the usual Honey Buzzards seems to be the Black-shouldered Kite, of which we saw two sitting on a tree. We therefore assume that the raptor that we saw in the distance, with hovering behaviour, was not a Kestrel but one of these birds.

The Warblers, of course, delighted us, and we were often at a loss to identify various songs, or know if it was the Black Drongo that was fooling us!

A Tawny-bellied Babbler was  an unsual sighting, as was that of a Jerdon's (I think...please confirm the id) Nightjar...not on the ground, but quite high up on a tree! 

The White-rumped Shama and the Asian Paradise Flycatcher flaunted themselves briefly before us.

After the Valley, we went further to Vaderahalli Lake,

 and enjoyed the sight of many waterfowl. Brahminy and Black Kites soared and swooped,  and we came to breakfast at Adiga's refreshed in mind and spirit.
