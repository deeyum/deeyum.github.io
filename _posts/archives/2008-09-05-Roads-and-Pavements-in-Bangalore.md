Time was, when a 60-foot wide road had at least 10 feet of pavements on either side, planted wih lovely shade-giving trees, which flowered serially through the year...

Now there is the more than 100-feet-wide Inner Ring Road near my home. The pavement, at the point at which I have photographed it, is not even as wide as I am tall...and I am SHORT!

We are doing a great job of killing off bird life, insect life and pedestrian life, all at one go.... or rather, gone!
