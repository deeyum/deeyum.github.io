Enjoyed the animation movie quite a lot...I did wonder what the dialogue would have been like in English! Great effort to bring mythology to the people, especially children. Alas, the theatre was sparsely populated....

I lost my heart to the poster of Baby Hanuman hung at the PVR Theatre. Want to ask the owners if they can let me have it when the movie goes away....

Going to see a London-troupe production of Measure for Measure, one of Shakespeare's less-known plays, tomorrow at Ranga Shankara. Sat and read the play just now. The man's mastery of psychology is amazing. The play is about a man who is to be put to death for sleeping with and impregnating a girl...when his sister goes to plead his cause, the magistrate says that if she sleeps with him he will pardon her brother. Things haven't changed over the centuries!

Quote from the play that could be written for today's judiciary, and for Bangalooru Mahanagara Palike:

"Thieves for their robbery have authority

When judges steal themselves." (Act 2, Scene 2, Lines 175/6, Measure for Measure)
