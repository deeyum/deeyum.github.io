We all went to Rockwoods Reservation, and Marilynn Motchan, who was baby-sitting her daughter's German Shepherd pup, Benny, took us on a short trail and showed me a lot of plants. I also saw some wild mammals, but that's for another post.

I wanted to get the Hummer on the flowers and a natural perch, and I was successful. Here are some of the photos:
