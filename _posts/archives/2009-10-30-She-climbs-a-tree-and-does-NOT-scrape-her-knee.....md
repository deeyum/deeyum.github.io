I went to the

<a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/"> Indian Institute of Science </a>

campus

to attend the 

<a href="http://www.canopy2009.org/"> 5th International Canopy Conference </a>

....there were demonstrations of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_climbing"> tree-climbing </a>

<lj-cut text="all about today&#39;s tree-climbing">


Here's Edward, an expert tree-climber, setting up the ropes for the different techniques:

here's what it looked like from a distance....Tarzan's hideout...

Here's <a href="http://wikimapia.org/4266266/Agumbe-Rainforest-Research-Station-ARRS"> Gowri Shankar </a> doing it fairly easily:

Here's <lj user="amoghavarsha"> who also managed to climb a reasonable height:

Yours truly getting into the harness (pics of me are by Gowri):

I looked rather suspiciously at the harness as I did not wish to appear in the next day's obituary columns:

Slowly, I too started climbing upwards:

It's a question of, er, getting the...hang of it!

Here's Edward, running around the branches of the tree and then letting himself down to the ground with the greatest of ease:

It will be many births before I can become a creature of the canopy like that....!
