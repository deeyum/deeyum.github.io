The refrigerator in the hospital nurses station can be used to store patients' food, and the condition is that food will be thrown away after 24 hours...so I had marked 30th April on the sticker.


The nurse then marked (above) the date when the food had to be used up/thrown away.... (after the "to")

They would be keeping the food for a long, long, long time if that date has to pass.....
