I want to know why all the Sardarji and other Indian jokes have this ghastly English (it's not Hinglish either, it's some...orrible English)...and also all those "inspiring, fantastic" photographs such as those of Google's founders or Steve Jobs etc....here's&nbsp; a couple of&nbsp;excerpts: 
<FONT face=Tahoma color=#333399 size=4><STRONG>So they kept name as GOOGLE



So one day he told to the staff: "<FONT face=Tahoma color=blue size=4><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">If I'll not get better name by 5 o'clcok today, our company's name will be anything he likes..." </SPAN></FONT></STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma color=navy size=4><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">
so at 5 o'clcok nobody comeup with better name, and he was eating APPLE that time... 
so he keep the name of the company</SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma color=blue size=4><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma"> </SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma color=red size=4><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma">'Apple Computers'

<FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3>Woo hoo...who writes these?</FONT>
