I'm having a conversation with <lj user="shortindiangirl"> about how to negotiate (for anything...a new job, rental, buying something) and I burst into rhyme:


When you are willing and able
To walk away from the table--
You are in a very strong postion
In any negotiation!

Negotiating is a complex dance
Where you give each other enough of a chance
To call it all off, or meet the other halfway...
And to leave goodwill intact...whatever you say.

Good negotiation
Requires skill...and imagination.
