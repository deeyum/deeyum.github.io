Early in the morning, I went off for my usual walk to Forest Park, and the weather was kind enough to allow me to wander around for two and a half hours! And one of the last things that delighted me was the sight of a beautiful litle

This looks like a female:

She was flying between the Coneflowers and the Chicory weeds:

She made a delightful picture, though catching her was a tough job as she flitted about:

But I enjoyed the sight of her...I waited about for the male, but had no luck...and walked home finally, satisifed with just my sight of "Thangam Mami"!

What was incredible was that it was almost exactly (just two days earlier) to the day, in 2009, that I had taken a video of a male Goldfinch, having a bath near the Suspension Bridge in Des Peres Creek:
