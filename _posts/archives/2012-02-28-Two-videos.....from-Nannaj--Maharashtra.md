Off to Ganeshgudi today, but after <lj user="prashanthchengi"> got my laptop working properly again (on Debian now, my windows are now closed!) I am slowly uploading videos of my Nannaj trip to YouTube.

Here's the magnificent raptor, the

MONTAGU'S HARRIER

And this pretty bird was a lifer for

and me...the

SPOTTED REDSHANK

as it strolled around in the waters of the lake...

We managed to get a lot out of the Nannaj trip, though it was very poorly organized. :))
