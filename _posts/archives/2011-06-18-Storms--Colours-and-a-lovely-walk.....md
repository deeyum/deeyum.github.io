I went for a walk to the 

<a href="http://www.ucpl.lib.mo.us/"> U City Public Library </a> 

and the 


Farmer's Market in the Loop

expecting a thunderstorm,  and enjoyed it thoroughly.

and you can see some of the landmarks of the Delmar Loop...

Here are two videos; one is the colour of rain:

And this is a rain of colours, in the lobby of the Moonrise Hotel:

Yes, I waited for the storm to subside and then carried on and finished my tasks :) The colours of the books were wonderful,too...why can't we have libraries like this at Bangalore?
