Driving back on Sunday, I realized that I had never gone to Ranganathittu after taking up either birding or photography; but the place would have been crowded,with Sunday trippers and tourists, so we decided to stop the car at the canal area. It was raining, so we used a short break in the showers to explore just a little bit, and were rewarded by the sight of these:

This is the Blacktipped Forest Glory (Vestalis apicalis) Damselfly (Thank you, Karthik!)

Ain't she a real beauty? And here's her golden sister:

That, according to Karthik, is the River Heliodor (Libellago lineata) damselfly. 


Then Gayathri also showed me this GREY PANSY (thanks for the id, Seshadri!) hiding in the dense greenery:

For confirmation of id, Seshadri sent me these links:
