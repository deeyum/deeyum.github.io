The Soligas were semi-nomadic in nature, but after the Biligiri Rangana Sanctuary was created, they settled down more or less permanently, and Skanda of ATREE took all of us to visit a Podu, or settlement. 

Here's what a traditional Soliga house looks like:

but now, of course, they are replaced by constructions of cement:

They have stopped growing ragi, and buy it nearby, though they still dry it in the traditional way:

Their main cultivation is now coffee, here's a coffee plant with berries:

Here are the harvested berries:

The beans are then extracted from the berries, and dried in the sun:

In their gardens they now grow vegetables such as tubers, and gourds:

They do have a lot of banana plantations, apart from sugar cane:
