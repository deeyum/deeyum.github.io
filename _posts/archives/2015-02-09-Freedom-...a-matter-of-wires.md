Do they not look delightful
Perched upon the wire,
Chatting together 
Against the sky?

When I see the same birds
Through the twisted wire
Of bird-cages, penned up...
I ask..why?

Why can we not just admire
The flower set upon the bush
Or smiling from its tree?

Why do we need to cage and tie down beings
That look so much better, when they are free?
