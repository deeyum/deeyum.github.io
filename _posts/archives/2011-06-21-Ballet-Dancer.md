Caution: this is an AWWW post and probably not of interest to anyone not related to KTB :)

KTB's uncle and aunt got her a tutu and a "head-frill" for her birthday, and she suddenly wanted to wear it this weekend. So her mother also showed her a ballet video:

Of course our little ballerina was very enthused....and I got to make my own ballet video!
