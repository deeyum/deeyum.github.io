To be out in the open air early in the morning, watching the birds slowly becoming active (yes, Bangalore birds are as slow as the rest of us, activity in these cloudy days only starts at around 7.30 or 8 AM!)....it's a great joy.

Some of the birds we saw (AND photographed, which wasn't always possible!), in no particular order....


We regularly seem to see this ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD in the area:

Just see that fierce "raptor" look!

This male INDIAN ROBIN was strutting around, showing his red vent (you can just see it under his tail):

Thankfully, he didn't moon me, as this disrespectful little PURPLE-RUMPED SUNBIRD did:

At the second gate of Valley School, we spotted this HOOPOE:

Our tiny friends the PALE-BILLED FLOWERPECKERs were there in force in the ornamental Cherry trees:

The sight of the WHITE-BROWED BULBUL was a welcome one:

We saw many more of their common RED-VENTED or RED-WHISKERED cousins:

We enjoyed watching several SCALY-BELLIED MUNIAS; at two locations, they were busy building nests. Here's one, probably asking the spouse if the soft furnishings are OK. You can see the long leaf that it's brought in; the munia made repeated trips and the first time, we didn't understand what that long-tailed bird was!

Another one is eating the grain  from the grasses on the  road:

Which is what several SILVERBILLS were also doing!

Several LAUGHING DOVES were around:

Of course, the WHITE-CHEEKED BARBETS were all around, too, making their typical calls:

I photographed these flowers, I wonder if it is the LAVENDER?

Some of these ornamental flowers have spread all over the slopes:

Two lovely mornings, spent with friends....!
