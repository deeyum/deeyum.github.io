Must write about Swamimalai Sterling Resort and about my wine-tasting experience...but am just listening to Tamizh classic film songs on Thein Kinnam on Jaya TV and it was interspersed by ads...particularly ONE campaign ad for Amma (can you believe it, the theme for today is also "thaai"(mother)?)...so emotional, describing ONE Mother (with a capital M, believe me!)'s love, sacrifice, foresight...ooh, I am nauseous...politics makes me sick, Indian politics makes me sicker, and Tamizh Nadu politics makes me SICKEST.

Bleeeaauuuughhhhh.....
