<LJ user="shortindiangirl"> sent me this:

Rail surfers (those who travel on top) have been threatened with paint, dogs and religion. Now Indonesia has strung concrete balls above the trains to bonk the overhead riders. Will that stop them ? No!! say the riders. Theyâ€™ve resisted arrests successfully, as well as the other measures. They like the wind, rush and views up there, plus the free ride is nice!
 
Here in St. Louis, we would bonk people on the head with concrete balls to MAKE them ride the train!

n the 1970's in Calcutta (Kolkata), there used to be the "Sardarji" buses (private buses run by this community) as well as the Government buses. The Government buses lost money, and the private buses did well. Travelling outside the bus (in some cases, the passenger would be attached to another passenger and never touch the bus at all) was so common that the private buses had one conductor for inside, and another for outside, the buses! Maybe that's the solution that Indonesia needs...!

Here's a pic of the "Sardarji" buses, little tin boxes, that I got off the net:
