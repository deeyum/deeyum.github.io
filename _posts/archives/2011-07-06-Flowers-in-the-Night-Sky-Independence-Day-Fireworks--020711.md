There were fireworks at 9.15 pm scheduled on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of July at the Gateway Arch. We went on the 2nd....on the 3rd, rain resulted in the fireworks being cancelled, and on the 4th, we looked up at the sky at the fireworks everyone around us was letting off (private fireworks are permitted on the 4th of July.)...and enjoyed the flowers in the sky from home.

Here are two videos I took at the Arch grounds:

Videos are always better for fireworks, but I've posted some photos, also, on my Facebook page,

Yesterday, as I walked in the evening, I saw the fireworks which several people were letting off privately ...and the noise and the light took me back to India for Deepavali :)

Next year, July 4th will be a Tuesday...I wonder if they will have a 4-day weekend with a compensatory working day later?
