I never knew anything about how comics were created...but the work of Carl Barks was always outstanding, even amongst the excellent Disney artists...I've laughed and enjoyed the stories and waited for the next comic book....

the witty stories, the little details in each picture panel...how much of delight I've had over my childhood years!
