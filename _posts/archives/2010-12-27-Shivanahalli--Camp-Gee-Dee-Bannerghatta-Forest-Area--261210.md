I was going to *strictly* stay at home, and do my packing and preparation for the trip to BR Hills tomorrow. So naturally, when Gopakumar called and asked if I would come with (alphabetical order) <lj user="anjali_ar">, <lj user="mamtanaidu"> and Peeyush, of course I immediately said yes! I'd been wanting to meet Gopa for a long time, and he'd told me that his daughter Madhumita had come with us to BR Hills (the Valley School trip.) So...ditch the pending work, and off I go! Any invitation to Bannerghatta forest...unthinkable to turn it down, especially with such company!

As usual, the day started with fog and mist...here is, I am not kidding...the sun!

<lj-cut text="about the morning">


Everyone appeared grey....

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8912.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8912.jpg" border="0" alt="sheet rcck 261210"></a>

But the sun did break through, and out came our binoculars!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8904.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8904.jpg" border="0" alt="binocs 261210"></a>

It was lovely to see the early light on the dewdrops, on the cactus:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8914.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8914.jpg" border="0" alt="dew on cactus sheet rock 261210"></a>


Here are the others, on the rocks of Ragidevara Betta:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8950.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8950.jpg" border="0" alt="tower rock 261210"></a>

Here's Vishnu, who gave us access to Camp Gee Dee, so that we could climb the betta (hillock)

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8994.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8994.jpg" border="0" alt="vishnu 261210"></a>


On the way back, we spotted two lovely sights: one, this vendor of shiny brass and bronze vessels:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9016.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9016.jpg" border="0" alt="bronze and copper 261210"></a>


and the beautiful way in which the walls of this house have been built, the traditional way, with stacked-up stone:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9018.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9018.jpg" border="0" alt="wall 261210"></a>

The tradition dates back several thousand years, when these dolmens were built up on the rock face: the bodies were set upon the rock face, and the top slab, held on load bearing granite pieces, was built up in a similar fashion, to form a burial site:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8957.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8957.jpg" border="0" alt="dolmen 261210"></a>

On the timeless (the rocks, called Peninsular Gneiss,  are among the oldest exposed rock in the world) surface, the 

PENINSULAR ROCK AGAMAS

bask in the sunshine:

Another reptile we spotted was the

CHAMELEON:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9014.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9014.jpg" border="0" alt="chameleon 261210"></a>





We saw an ants' nest on the way up:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8922.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8922.jpg" border="0" alt="ants&#39; nest 261210"></a>

and this beautiful

SPIDER WASP:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8935.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8935.jpg" border="0" alt="spider wasp 261210"></a>

We looked at several interesting trees, ranging from the Indian Laburnum, to the tree from the wood of which the Chennapatna toys are made. (Gopa, I want the scientific name of it once again!)

This un id wildflower looked beautiful in the sunlight:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8990.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8990.jpg" border="0" alt="wldflower 261210"></a>

We found the winged seeds of the

Holarrhena antidysenterica tree:

I didn't photograph too many birds, but this

KESTREL 

was a great sighting, first soaring above us, and then sitting on a far-off tree, eating its prey:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8956.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8956.jpg" border="0" alt="kestrel 261210"></a>

this backlit

PIED BUSHCHAT

actually started us off!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8916.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8916.jpg" border="0" alt="bushchat 261210 gd"></a>



Another lovely sighting was this

BLACK DRONGO in its iridiscent black plumage...it's  sitting on top of a cow (the full photo is in the Picasa album, link  below.)

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_8998.jpg" border="0" alt="blk drngo 261210"></a>

I'm sure the others will produce even better pics, just wait for the links! A wonderful morning.... I came home only by 1pm! Gopa's breakfast offering of two loaves of bread and cheese spread was wolfed down, but we then called him a "double loafer". Vishnu hospitably offered us welcome cups of chai and fruit juice and a nice chat, too.

 Having never really caught up with the work afterwards, and having to go out the entire evening....I am, of course, sitting and making this post instead of packing my bag for BR Hills tomorrow!

Oooh, I *love* Bannerghatta forests....
