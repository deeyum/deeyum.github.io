She's running the half-marathon this coming weekend...and quite often, she suffers from feelings of inadequacy (completely discounting the fact that she has a full-time, demanding career, and child of a year-and-a-five-months)...so she loved getting this email from someone:

"Just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate everything you do in the name of running. Whether its out of love for the sport or the love of positively challenging your body's limits or both, your writing about and attitude to running are inspiring. 

So is your support of the lesser experienced runners, helping them find their feet and pacing them through their initial runs. Personally, those two initial runs you ran with me in creve coeur lake and forest park were strongly positive experiences which helped me find the strength to complete longer runs on my own (ex: when I was late). In just over two months I went from running 2 to 12 miles, which is huge. Just in case you are worried about setting that personal record, know that your running is doing a lot more..."

While I do think that my approach to life (do what I can comfortably do, don't stress myself reaching out for more challenges)suits me fine and keeps me happy; while  I sometimes wish that she would accept a slower pace of life and be more happy; while it grieves me when I see her struggling to achieve everything and feeling down..... I respect her being different from me in this respect, and feel happy when she feels appreciated!
