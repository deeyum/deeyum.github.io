One blooming flower
Takes many a weary (and expensive) hour
But the first flower of a weed...
It blooms at great speed!

But having said that...I walked through Forest Park in sleety, shivery weather today, and I saw the first daffodil in bloom:

I think that it's we who draw the lines and call some flowers weeds....
