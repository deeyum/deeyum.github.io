My daughter and son-in-law came back from their skiing vacation in Aspen, and she told me that D had fallen and broken his leg. I expressed concern and the glee of the "April Fool" came clearly down the wires. I told her it was April third ( and  April 2 for her)...but she was unrepentant...the dearest IDIOT! :)))

No, that is not what is irritating me! That..is something that I hope will pass. It WILL pass (like Jesus, who never fails.)

Lousy jokes DO cheer me up a lot.
