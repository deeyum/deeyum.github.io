When there is a baby in the house, and the parents are having a "working holiday"...in India, at least, life is very chaotic, because one is juggling callers, domestic help, and the baby's routine, and  outings and visits that have to be made in the very limited time that is available to the parents.

Everyone has things to do and different frames of time...to keep all the skeins from getting tangled is quite difficult. At least I am able to make sure that everyone eats lunch together (in fact today three people even ate breakfast together) and that's a major acheivement!

And I must have time to enjoy KTB's antics, here she is with a little spin top that spun around her....

The weather also keeps beckoning me out, but I can't spend too much time outdoors...KTB leaves very early on Sunday morning, so time with her is very precious, too...so the solution is (right now) to strap her into her stroller and all of us go for a walk... 

Meanwhile, KTB enjoys the lawn....

She explores the world of the Internet....

and she repays her g'mom for milk by clawing at her face and pinching HARD (and chortling with glee when said g'mom yells with pain!)
