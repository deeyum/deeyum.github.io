I am not kidding, people are taking a comprehensive exam on this topic:

 29th July 2008: Comprehensive Exam: Molecular Ecology of thePrimitively Eusocial Wasp Ropalidia marginata: Metapopulation Structure,Genetic Relatedness and Queen Succession

And here I am, leading a blithe life...does eusocial mean being friendly in all the European countries?

This post is for you, <LJ user="premkudva">. I don't think we belong on this planet of "human doings".
