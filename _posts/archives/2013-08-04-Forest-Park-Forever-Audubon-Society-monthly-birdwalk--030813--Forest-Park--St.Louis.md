We gathered and walked out of the Visitors' Center:

Mark took us to see the Charles, the male 

GREAT HORNED OWL:

<lj-cut text="more images from the morning">

A male

AMERICAN GOLDFINCH

delighted us with flashes of yellow:

In the distance (across Lindell Blvd) we saw, through the cloudy weather, a 

GREEN HERON

almost in silhouette:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429014017/" title="DSC04968 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3809/9429014017_e79d775a61.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04968"></a>

On the same tree, a

RED-TAILED HAWK

also sat; it was very pale indeed, even for a juvenile:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429030481/" title="DSC04970 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/9429030481_36101592a7.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04970"></a>

Meanwhile, I learnt that this is 

POISON IVY:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429030297/" title="DSC04971 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5337/9429030297_85f2b1e96e.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04971"></a>

(Throughout the walk, Amy, Jim and others taught me a lot about the plants and trees that I saw.)

We followed the course of the creek, and we saw a

NORTHERN FLICKER

and a

MOURNING DOVE

on the bank:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429028655/" title="DSC04977 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2888/9429028655_08c3b8d253.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="DSC04977"></a>

Pat is a heroine in my book; she turns out for the walks in spite of having a lot on her plate to deal with:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431796110/" title="DSC04979 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5488/9431796110_0f0a9a67f5.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04979"></a>

Was this a 

WREN

or a 

SONG SPARROW?

with just the silhouette to go by, we were not sure...but the song decided us that it was the latter.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431795710/" title="DSC04982 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/9431795710_4b048bc458.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04982"></a>

That  delightful summer visitor,the

RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD
 
made several appearances (all, alas, high up on trees, where we could not see the shimmering colours!)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431795446/" title="DSC04986 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7287/9431795446_d1865fa2fe.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04986"></a>

The 

IRONWEED

was in flower:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431795178/" title="DSC04987 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/9431795178_e539a3ea40.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04987"></a>

We followed the Kingfishers down the creek:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429026557/" title="DSC04993 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7395/9429026557_269cc5b13c.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04993"></a>

The 

WATERLILY 

and the

WATER PRIMROSE

looked pretty in the water:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431793444/" title="DSC04994 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7378/9431793444_8e84e43c46.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC04994"></a>

This wildflower looked beautiful with the raindrops!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431793168/" title="DSC05003 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/9431793168_40156db144.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05003"></a>

As did this one, which Marilynn Motchan id'd the next day at Rockwoods Reservation, as

SENNA:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429024581/" title="DSC05004 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/9429024581_51ae438906.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05004"></a>

We saw several 

EASTERN KINGBIRDS

(and some Eastern Phoebes, too)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431791982/" title="DSC05008 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5335/9431791982_476e2d600f.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05008"></a>

Another Green Heron came and landed behind the reeds, and proceeded to make a meal off a frog.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431791632/" title="DSC05010 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7455/9431791632_cea2c11a29.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05010"></a>

I spotted these

APHIDS

(Amy Witt id'd them for me) on a plant...they looked beautiful!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429023071/" title="DSC05018 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/9429023071_49ef0d5fa4.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="DSC05018"></a>

Here are the flowers of the plant:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429022875/" title="DSC05020 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/9429022875_ef6bcfe09c.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05020"></a>

Some of the native grasses are as beautiful as carefully-bred cultivars!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429022645/" title="DSC05021 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7383/9429022645_c6c371e594.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05021"></a>

Waterlilies, both white

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429021455/" title="DSC05022 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9429021455_864b757703.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05022"></a>

and pink

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431789160/" title="DSC05023 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/9431789160_4ab4f76c2d.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05023"></a>

were a treat to the eye.

These are called SEA OATS, but I agree with Jim Wilson...when we are near the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers, RIVER OATS is a better name!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431781614/" title="DSC05026 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/9431781614_2e20263a95.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="DSC05026"></a>

This is the

BOTTLE-BRUSH GRASS:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431788152/" title="DSC05030 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2814/9431788152_9d8e672f47.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05030"></a>

Jim told me that when

POKEWEED

turns this wonderful magenta, it's poisonous to humans:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429019637/" title="DSC05031 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3800/9429019637_1828dea98c.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05031"></a>

As we crossed a muddy ditch, we saw this

JEWEL PLANT (also called Touch-me-not) blooming:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431787058/" title="DSC05038 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/9431787058_ce21ab282d.jpg" width="500" height="327" alt="DSC05038"></a>

I was also very happy to see the first few 

MONARCH

butterflies of the season:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431786742/" title="DSC05042 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7295/9431786742_6ea9da18e8.jpg" width="500" height="328" alt="DSC05042"></a>

This

PEARLY CRESCENT

was also beautiful...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429016035/" title="DSC05074 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5453/9429016035_7ff925f018.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="DSC05074"></a>


Brenda spotted this beautiful

COOPER'S HAWK 

in the air, being mobbed by several other birds:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429018789/" title="DSC05050 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/9429018789_e742fb10da.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05050"></a>

The walk came to an end with Karen announcing Audubon Society free birdwalks for September and October:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431786434/" title="DSC05051 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/9431786434_33e349897a.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05051"></a> 

Bradley, Mark, Brenda and I continued onwards for another look at the Great Horned Owls. It's long been a running joke that Mark always spots Barred Owls, and I have never seen one, yet. This morning, too, he arrived with a shot of one that he'd just seen...and when we went there, of course, the Bird Had Flown! (That's what I call "Avian Flew"!) We teased Mark that he'd probably taken that photo in Yellowstone and come down to meet us! 

We saw the Red-tailed Hawk sitting on a tree again (near the Visitors' Center)...and this was a really amazing sight. The other birds were very perturbed by the Hawk..but a tiny Hummer sat on another branch of the tree, quite unconcerned! 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431370093/" title="DSC05063 rt hawk and hmng bd 030813 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/9431370093_2832a3afd5.jpg" width="500" height="275" alt="DSC05063 rt hawk and hmng bd 030813"></a>


The Hawk sat on the left-hand-side of the tree, and the Hummer, a  tiny dot,on the extreme right.

Here's the Hawk:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431785850/" title="DSC05066 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/9431785850_ae9d8b5bc0.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05066"></a>


Here's the Hummer in closeup (thank goodness for the huge zoom on my camera!)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431785980/" title="DSC05058 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5508/9431785980_4c54206a60.jpg" width="500" height="280" alt="DSC05058"></a>

We saw this

MALLARD

mother with her children:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9431785736/" title="DSC05069 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2889/9431785736_4c99558755.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05069"></a>

</lj-cut>


And we wound up watching Sarah, the female Great Horned Owl, and then, one of the young ones, in the wooded area:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9429017397/" title="DSC05070 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/9429017397_0e9efddffc.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC05070"></a>
