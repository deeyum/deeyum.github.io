It really is worth taking along the camera, no matter where and when I go....I got ample proof of this when I decided to take KTB for a walk in Forest Park. I put her in her stroller, and entered the park at the History Museum, as usual, and was walking along the edge of the golf course towards the Grand Basin...when I suddenly saw a

RED-TAILED HAWK,

which was standing over its prey:

That look, directed at me, was to warn me to keep away from what he'd captured

But there were many walkers along that path (I'd stopped where I was, to take more photographs), so he flew into a nearby tree:

I took the opportunity to take a few close-up shots of the beautiful raptor:

He certainly was giving everyone annoyed looks as they prevented him from tucking into his meal:

I also photographed the prey, which was a baby 

COTTONTAIL RABBIT:

Poor little rabbit, having two rabbit's feet wasn't lucky for him! 

So..even when taking a toddler in a stroller, one can have an exciting birding session :))))
