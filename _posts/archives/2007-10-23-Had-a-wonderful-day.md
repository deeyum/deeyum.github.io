Though I don't really celebrate birthdays (we believe that every day one is alive, happy, and in good health is a day to celebrate), it WAS nice today...<LJ user="anushsh"> put up a post wishing me, and several people called up...and I got some affectionate calls from expected, and completely unexpected, people! The cockles of my heart are so warmed that it is causing moisture to condense from my eyes...friends are SUCH a treasure.Thank you, each and every one of you. I am 53 today..and I feel as if I am about half that age! A combination of good health, and a very happy life...

Thank you, <LJ user="anushsh">, I had a great time at the Ranga Shankara festival with your company, and with Geeta Ramani too. The fact that today's play was excellent helped, too.

Now <LJ user="amoghavarsha"> was supposed to get me one of the several Belgian Dark Chocolates that he owes me, and I have heard his account of conducting a photography workshop for 15 people ranging from 11 to 67...but the rain has put paid to that plan, and we are probably going somewhere else for dinner....

A very nice day, starting with a lOOOOOONg conversation with beloved dotter and beloved-er son-in-law...what more can one ask of life? If I rubbed a lamp now and a genie came and said I could make 3 personal wishes..I would be hard put to find something personal that I want. 

I am really lucky in my life. I must have been practically a divine saint in my last birth to earn this kind of karma!

Anyway, here's a picture of a beautiful little bird...
