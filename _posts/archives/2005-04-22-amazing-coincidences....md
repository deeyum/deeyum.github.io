Got a call from someone today, regarding the article I had written in the Deccan Herald about Quizfamilies, the monthly family quiz group I moderate....there have been several responses, many of whom actually turned up at this month's quiz.....well, anyway, today the lady who called was brought up in Calcutta, has an only daughter who is married and in the US, the daughter is called Deepa but with a li attached at the end....we had a long conversation and I am thoroughly enjoying having many new people to meet!
