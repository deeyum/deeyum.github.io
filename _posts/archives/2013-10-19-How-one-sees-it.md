The Hindu piously said 
To the fez-adorned head:
"Even if it is Bakrid...
Does not the slaughtered goat still bleed?"

The Muslim smiled. "Oh, yes, we wield
The axe. The sugarcanes in that field
And millions more, are scythed away
To make sweets on Diwali day!"

It's not what one kills, but what one is used to killing, that makes one inured to it...and not think of it as killing at all! Do we think that we are murdering ants, roaches, rats, worms, or mosquitoes?Is it OK to kill plants to eat them, and not OK to kill animals for the same purpose?
