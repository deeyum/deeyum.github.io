When did you grow up, my little baby?
The tears that I wiped,
The messes I cleaned,
The questions I answered,
The little body that I rocked
Through sleepless nights...
When did this adult
Emerge from her girlhood?
Herself a mother of two today,
Balancing work, home and much else,
Thinking for herself, compassionate and caring...
The little worm that emerged from my body
Who was a pupa which I could not peer into
For a while as she went abroad....
She's truly emerged as a beautiful butterfly
Who, being happy herself, delights others.
