This morning, I was walking and thinking about the baseball team that's named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cardinal"> RED CARDINAL </a> :

I looked to up to see the amazing sight of a skein (it's a "skein" in the air, a "gaggle" on the ground) of CANADA GEESE fly past in the <a href="http://theleadership.wordpress.com/2006/06/10/synergy-why-do-geese-fly-in-a-v-formation/"> typical "V" formation </a>

It was uplifting to see them, and it wasn't only my head, but my spirits too, that was (were?) lifted up!

And then, as I continued my walk, I was able to spot (and actually photograph, before it flew off in a flash, in the drizzling rain), this beautiful<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Jay"> BLUE JAY </a> (there's also a baseball team named after it in Toronto, Canada!)...

Thanks for the id, <LJ user="chaibacca">.


The crest that the wiki clearly shows, was probably wet in the rain...the bird was, quite literally, crestfallen! :)
