The Spelling Chequer (or poet tree without misttakes) 

Eye have a spelling chequer  
It came with my pea sea  
It plainly marks four my revue  
Miss steaks eye cannot see  

Each thyme when I have struct the quays  
Eye weight four it two say  
If watt eye rote is wrong or rite  
It shows me strait a weigh  

As soon as a mist ache is maid  
It nose bee fore too late  
And eye  can put the error rite  
Eye really fined it grate  

I've run this poem threw it  
I'm sure your policed to no  
It's letter perfect in its weigh  
My chequer tolled me sew
