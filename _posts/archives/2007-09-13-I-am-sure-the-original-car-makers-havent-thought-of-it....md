Have you seen a Mini Volvo before?

Our autorickshaws are endlessly creative about what to call themselves!

This one's for <LJ user="chaibacca">, who first pointed out how autorickshaws had "1000 cc" and "2000 cc" and in some up-to-date instances, "2004 cc" (yes, I recently did see one "2007 cc") painted on their backs!
