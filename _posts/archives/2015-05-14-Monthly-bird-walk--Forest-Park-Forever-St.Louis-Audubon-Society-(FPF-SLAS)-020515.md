The first Saturday of every month, SLAS, along with Forest Park Forever, organizes a Beginners' Bird Walk, and the 2nd of May was a great day, when a huge number of birders (54, according to Amy Witt!) met up in the morning, at Kennedy Forest, the wooded area at the southwest corner of Forest Park.

Here are some of the birds we saw:

Rose-breasted Grosbeak (a lifer for me)

We agreed that it had been a very productive morning, even though I didn't know the names of many of the beautiful things I'd seen.
