I was looking at my friends' page...April 3rd. And just to see if there were any entries I had missed, I clicked on the "earlier" icon at the bottom of the page. 

WHAM! Time travel accelerated. I was taken to a March 21st entry! (And I have been looking at umpteen entries in the days in between, because my friends' list is pretty large.)

Votappened? Can any techie explain to this SMI (Simple-Minded Ignoramus)?
