Which is one of my favourite places to go off to for a couple of days when I can?

Here's a postage stamp of it, which I saw quite by chance, when a letter with this stuck on arrived at my doorstep:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_2524.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_2524.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

By the way (not btw), the graininess is on the STAMP picture. I am not guilty.

And what I like about the stamp is....the ever-present, space-hogging tiger (yes, the SIT that doesn't exist) is NOT featured on it. LOTS of other fauna, that make Bandipur such a wonderful place.

<LJ user="chirdeep_shetty"> has a few more days to go on his assignment with JLR there. As far as I am concerned, his initials are...I.N.V. Chirdeep!
