I attended a lovely wedding today; here are the happy couple, exchanging garlands, a ritual signifying one soul in two bodies:

The bride wears white, and the groom has a "jariga pAga" (gold-lace turban)....he is showing "arati" to her, as if to say, let the purifying fire protect you from all evil, and harm...

Here's the bride, in a shower of rice, thrown as a benison...
