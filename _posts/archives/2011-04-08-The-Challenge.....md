We first watched this magnificient tusker cross the jeep path in the Kaziranga Central Range:

And a little later, this Makana (tuskless male) came along in the long grass, also wanting to cross the path.

Suddenly the tusker wheeled back and appeared at the edge of the path, challenging the Makana.

We could see both of them regarding each other:

They approached each other:

With bated breath, we watched the encounter:

But then, the confrontation ended abruptly, and they turned away from each other; the drama was at an end. They seemed to amble off fairly peacefully...

And later, we saw them both near each other, apparently without any aggression!
