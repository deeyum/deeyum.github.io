KM had brought back a selection of cheeses from the US, so when some friends suddenly decided to drop in, out they came, along with some Tapena wine....

Some of the cheeses were not very solid, and some rather crumbly, so we couldn't really set it out artistically.

It was also an experiment, photography-wise...I realize cheese is not greatly amenable to a flash!

Here we are, helping ourselves:

I wanted to focus on the wine first:

And then on the wine, woman (and cheese!)....

I then realized that the best way to get the colour of the wine was to get it against the light.
