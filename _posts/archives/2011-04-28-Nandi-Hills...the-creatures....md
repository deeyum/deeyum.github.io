Sunday's trip to Nandi Hills was particularly satisfying, as Kannan had his wish for the Tickell's Blue Flycatcher fulfilled..really FULL filled! Here are two poses by the beautiful bird:

Another great sighting, which, alas, Anand missed, having to go back early (he was taking an evening flight to the US) was ...these two 

EGYPTIAN VULTURES

sitting companionably on the microwave station tower!

It was also not as difficult as usual to get photographs of the little yellow feather-scraps, the 

ORIENTAL WHITE-EYES:

here it is, on a "Powder Puff" flower:

Another tiny bird that we were able to observe was the 

COMMON TAILORBIRD

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3811-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3811-1.jpg" border="0" alt="tlrbd 240411 nh"></a>


here is one, busily preening:

I got a lovely sequence and put it up on 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/807039.html"> this post </a>

Yet another small yet pretty bird was this

ASHY PRINIA:

the

ORANGE-HEADED THRUSH

was all around us!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_3737.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_3737.jpg" border="0" alt="o hded thrsh nh 240411"></a>

as we were looking at something else, I looked up and spotted this

BRAHMINY KITE

eating what was, obviously, a dead BARBET:

It was lovely to catch sight of the 

GREY-HEADED CANARY FLYCATCHER:

I was able to get a nice eye-level shot of the

PUFF-THROATED BABBLER:

It was not just the birds that held our attention, though they were, of course, in the majority.

Here's a little

SPIDER

on what I call the "Cobra Hood" flower:

this beautiful, un id insect had us all clicking away!

I asked Poornima to hold up the 

FIG

from the Ficus tree:

It was amusing, as usual, to watch the antics of the

BONNET MACAQUES

and here's a little one, secure in his mother's arms, and suckling contentedly:
