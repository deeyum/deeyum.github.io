It's very difficult to get videos of Kalyan, as he's too fast for me, and the ambient noise with two children is always too high! 

But I finally got him with his Tangram, which he's quite good at.

He started putting the pieces that matched the shapes.

There was a victorious cackle:

And then he proceeded to make the pieces into the shape of a "P":

Another game he loves is hiding. "Kalyan engEy?" I must call out to the sofa and the suspicious-looking  pillows. See...they are "armed"!

Then our hero shows himself, and I have to yell, "dOkkAnEy!" (abbreviation of "idho irukkAnEy" which means, "HERE he is!"

He's an elf with personality plus!
