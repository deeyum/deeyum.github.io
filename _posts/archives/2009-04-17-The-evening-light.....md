Much has been spoken about the morning light for photography, but sometimes, the evening light is also just wonderful. The sky itself takes on a luminous glow and slowly the brightness fades from the air....hues of pink and mauve slowly shade down to purples and indigos....the coolness of the air after the heat of the day, and the sense of the day's work done, add to the sense of peace and serenity.

Here are some spot-billed ducks, calmly floating in the evening waters at Kukkerhalli Lake...

I love the description of the evening in <a href="http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Poetry/Elegy.htm"> Thomas Gray's poem, The Elegy </a>.....
