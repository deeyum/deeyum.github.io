I didn't click too many pictures of flowers, trees and fruit, we were so busy with the birds....but here are some ones that did catch my eye.


This one is not a wild flower; it's been planted all along the slopes, but with the backlight, it looked wonderful!

The trees in the nursery apparently include a lot of trees with  these beautiful flowers; I used to eat these fruits as a child, but don't know what they are called.

I loved the rounded fullness of the citron fruit (perhaps it's called grapefruit in English, I don't know) on some of the trees...

Short list, isn't it?  I did take some ones that made me sad, of birds foraging amongst the plastic bags...but decided not to post 'em...!
