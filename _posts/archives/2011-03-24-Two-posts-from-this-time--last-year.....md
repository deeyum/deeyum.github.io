Just finshed watching Ms. Hurricane Hair KTB playing with her toys while her parents ate dinner....

How did this post come about?

I was talking to Arun about nestboxes and how birds sometimes don't use them. So went to the Housefinch entry...and found it was almost zigackly a year ago. I don't really go trawling over my old posts to find something interesting to <strike> repost </strike> share with my friends!
