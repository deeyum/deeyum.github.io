You can see the sun, when you can bear the ferocity of it splendour:

And as is sinks into the western sky:

But when the moon is in the fourth phase of its waxing, mythology has it that it is inauspicious to look upon it:

Apparently, waxing and waningin force and power is acceptable, but waxing and waning in appearance is not!

I did look at, and photograph, the moon on Ganesha Chathurthi day....let's see what happens to me!

Off to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary for the day, with 7 others.
