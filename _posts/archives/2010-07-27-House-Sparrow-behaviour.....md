HOUSE SPARROWS

used to be common birds in most Indian cities. But in Bangalore at least, there was a serious decline, and it is a joy to see them back in certain areas of the city, and its outskirts.

I posted this picture of a beautiful male:

And in Kabini, I was able to take a video of two things they love to do...one, have a good water bath:

and the second, having a mud (or in this case, a grass!) bath:

Sparrows are such perky, lively creatures...it's a real joy to have them around!
