I  picked up the shampoo bottle in my bathroom.It said,"refreshing shampoo...orange blossom with pro-vitamin B5"...and that conjures up such a beautiful vision of sun-kissed oranges helping my hair to a lustrous shine. I then idly turned it over and continued to read.


"We have created a mild shampoo that hydrates as it cleans.  Our shampoo delivers body and shine. For all hair types and gentle enough for daily use."

So far, so good.

Then came the kicker.

"Ingredients:  Aqua ( ah,well, that's water in Latin...), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (at this point my eyes jerked open!),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA (notice that's not been expanded, could be Deadly Expensive Arsenic), Parfum (that's perfume in    French...Latin, French, what next?), Panthenol,Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol ( ohmigod,what's THAT?),Sodium Chloride (they have SALT in this?) DMDM Hydantoin,Tetrasodium EDTA (YOW!), Citric Acid,Brown 1, Blue 1, Red 40 (what are those colours and numbers?),Benzyl Salicylete, Lilial, Citronellol,Linalool (LINALOOL???).

"Made exclusively for Le Meridien."

I suppose I could google all those chemicals...but I am afraid to.


All those chemicals make a MILD shampoo? And, mind you, this is a shampoo that LISTS its ingredients. Many shampoos just don't, but talk glowingly about health and shine and have those Photoshop-tweaked pictures of incredible hair....

I have incredible hair....that is,it's incredible that I have hair at all, after applying this gunk to wash it!
