I post on Metroblogs, and often I get responses (which come to my gmail id)...and when I reply to that email id, it says, "no such user"....

for eg:

This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification

Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently:

    fdkj@gmail.com

Technical details of permanent failure:
UNKNOWN_USER: No such user

How do they do it? I want to know....

And why do they do it? I will never know...
