Had just one day in Bangalore after returning from Thattekkad, and I went off to B R Hills.

Why do I go rushing to the forests like this? Here's one image that might be an answer:

While we were driving back, we found these cattle decorated for 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankranthi"> SankrAnthi or Pongal </a>


our harvest festival, where cattle are revered....(it's really a case of Holy Cow!)

This bordering of the eyes with blue seems to be something new, but we often found it on the cattle we saw...

And then we watched this procession, where the decorated cattle are taken:

The man on the scooter is already extending his hand to give some money...the truck is also decorated...and the man in front is beating a single-faced drum to attract the passers-by's attention.

Our festivals are very colourful...and the forests provide a quiet, soothing contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city...both are wonderful parts of my life.
