Felt somewhat emotional today as I went to see off <LJ user="oldhen">. Didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted to over the visit, as we were travelling a lot and when we were in town, he wasn't....sigh, =hope I get to spend more time at least with another "daughter's-friend-turned-into-friend" who is just beginning HIS month-long visit...another classmate of  <LJ user="shortindiangirl"> who has brought so many great people into my life!
