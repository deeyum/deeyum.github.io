I tear off the leaf of my daily calendar.It's a habit that's a long-standing one... for many years, I always asked my sister in law, <LJ user="itsalouwelylife"> to buy a "rANi mutthu" daily calendar for me (I was  superstitious..the 2 years that I bought one for myself, I lost my parents, and then again, once, when I did this, I lost my brother. Now, I've lost a lot, including the superstition, and I buy my own.)

At the start of the year, it's a fat, thick wad of papers. It represents the future..unknown, yet to be experienced. There are hopes, there are fears. There is speculation on what may come to pass...or not.

Then, the leaves slowly start dropping. No, it's not fall, it's just the daily tear-off. 

This year, there was a big hiatus from June to November. I came back from a visit to Scandinavia and the US, and tore off a huge chunk of the future-that-had-turned-into-the-past.Since then, it's been pretty much a leaf a day, except the visit to Delhi which lasted a week. (I should have got my sis in law a calendar when I went, but it hadn't come on sale yet.)

Now, the piece of cardboard has just a few leaves...dates....attached. Detachment...when I detach the leaves from the calendar, why don't I also practice another kind of detachment? I should let the past go. Missing my grandchildren so intensely that it hurts...missing things from a past life that will never return...why do I allow these unprofitable thoughts? Attachment must drop from me, as the leaves do when I pull them off the calendar.

I will go out in a day or two, and get another calendar. Soon, it will be time for this baby-fat Murugan to go to the recycling, while another one will smile at me, over another stuck-together-with-cloth-and-gum pile of 365 small sheets of paper, that tell me the date according to the English and Tamizh calendars, tell me the auspicious and inauspicious times of the day, the "star" of the day, the time of the lunar month, and mention which south Indian temple has what festival....and also what festival it is for several other religions, as well as leaders' birthdays and national holidays and Hindu festivals. For example, today it has the picture of C Rajagopolachari whose birthday it is, and a Santa with balloons to denote Christmas.

My daily calendar...an unobtrusive yet essential part of my daily life. Tearing a page  off usually means that twenty-four hours have gone by. What have I achieved? What have I thought? How have I treated others? I do not always introspect...but I am doing so now, when there are just a few leaves left. 

Let me muse on the way this year has gone, as time creeps past, and the leaves fall from my mind, and my life, as well as from my calendar....
