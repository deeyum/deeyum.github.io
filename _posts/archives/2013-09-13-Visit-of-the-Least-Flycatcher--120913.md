I went out to the backyard, it was cloudy, today.
I thought I'd send the usual Starlings flying away.
Perhaps a Robin, and a Sparrow or two....
But the birds that I saw...were something new.

Smaller than a Sparrow in size,
With white rings around their eyes.

The behaviour was definitely like a Flycatcher;
Their presence delighted this surprised bird watcher.

They then turned their backs, and one of the things
I could do was, see the markings upon their wings.

Though they were new in the backyard, they were not rare;
Yet I clicked them so that this experience I could share.

In a matter of minutes, away they flew;
I too turned indoors, I had the day's work to do.

Throughout the day, the joy stayed with me...
But..it wasn't the Eastern Wood Peewee!

The bird id was probably <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Least_Flycatcher/id">Flycatcher, Least </a>..
Come to enjoy our garden's feast.
Definitely an Empidonax...
Which one, I don't know... so please, donax!


I've documented and shared it, and done my duty;
Click on the bird's name for more about the little beauty!
