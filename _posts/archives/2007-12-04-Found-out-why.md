I found out why my tags are not displaying. Being a technoramus (technical ignoramus) I didn't realize that I could not add as many tags as I wanted. When the no. of tag words went past 1000, it stopped the display...but without any message to me about it, which they could have included....

Thanks to <LJ user="anushsh"> for helping me arrive at what the problem was. Sitting and deleting tags, as if I didn't have any better work to do. :(((

Also the new laptop reFUSES to connect.

Lord Murphy is the presiding deity in my home.
