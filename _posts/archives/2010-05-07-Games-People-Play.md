I wonder why Google and Yahoo find it necessary to do dozens of rounds of interviews before hiring someone...if the hirer just sits down for an evening of board games, or card games, with the "hiree"....that will surely tell them all about the person.

The way someone plays a game reveals so much about that person...and the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful...it all comes out within just a few hours. If the person refuses to play board games, well, that says something about the person, too!

And I think it's also true that if you are comfortable playing board games with someone, you'll be comfortable with that person in other situations, too.
