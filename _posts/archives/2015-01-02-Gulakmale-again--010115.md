When I got a call from Vaibhav that he, Chandu and Venkat were going birding,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15980217339" title="IMG_8485 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7518/15980217339_a5c1f03130_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8485"></a>

 I could not resist the temptation, and off we went. The drizzly rain certainly cast a damper on the opening hours of the outing, and we tried our luck at Vaderahalli Lake

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16166274105" title="IMG_8492 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7516/16166274105_d7f09604f7_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8492"></a>

<lj-cut text="The rain let up and the birds started arriving....."> 

 before we went to Gulakmale. However, though we manfully trudged over the bund of the lake with the song, "Raindrops keep fallin' on my head" being the main theme, the rain could not keep up with our persistence, 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15543937314" title="IMG_8501 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7563/15543937314_dfa14c4d5f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8501"></a>

and the sightings began to improve considerably.


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16140566176" title="IMG_8545 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7478/16140566176_5df917dda9_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8545"></a>

 Of course, the Asian Openbills were the first to greet us, 


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15978935498" title="IMG_8547 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7544/15978935498_019a8700cf_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8547"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16166278965" title="IMG_8498 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7573/16166278965_484ff9964d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8498"></a>

 but several species differed...so the bird list is almost-the-same-but-not-quite!

We ranged right across the diameter of the lake today, and we found that there is a foresty patch that harbours several woodland birds. We spotted the Blue-faced Malkoha in the patch.

The highlights, of course, were the different fishing methods of the birds...wading, diving, zooming into the water. The birds of prey, even the Kites, appeared only a while after the rain stopped. 

Today the reeds in the lake bed yielded three kinds of Munias, and we were happy to stand and observe them, as well as the Prinias there.  Thanks to the low water level,  I was able to squish my way to the patch of land that is normally the central island. The rain truly made it a "Muddy kere", but I didn't mind, as I watched all three kinds of Kingfishers...the the Small Blue, the Pied, White-breasted, at work, getting breakfast.

We took a short while at the Thottikallu Falls/temple area, and returned home well satisfied with the bounty we'd got on the first day of the year.

Some other small things caught my eye.

Are those who set this tiny Linga and the Basava hoping to start yet another temple?

Even weeds were beautiful:

We did not like this red-capped, brown-breasted Kingfisher.

Here's the rest of the fish after the birds have done with it:

Here's wishing all of you a very happy, health, and peaceful 2015..with plenty of opportunities to walk (with muddy shoes!)  amidst the treasures that Nature provides us, even in an urban setting.
