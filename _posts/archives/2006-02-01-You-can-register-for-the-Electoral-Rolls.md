As I could not vote last time ( my name was not found in my old constituency) I decided to register afresh on the Election Commission website; it's so convenient. You can register, too,if you live in Karnataka, at

Remember..each and every one of us needs to vote. The last time, a huge section of us didn't vote and that's how S M Krishna went and we got the pack of jokers who have let Bangalore (and the rest of Karnataka too) go to pot and pothole.

Nothing will keep me from voting this time round....
