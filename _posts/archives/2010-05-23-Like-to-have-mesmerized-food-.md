We went to another Ethiopian restaurant, just for a change from

...this was 

<lj-cut text="the Ethiopian restaurant">,

<a href="http://www.meskeremstl.com/"> Meskerem </a>

named after the first month of the Ethiopian calendar.

So this time I decided to label all the dishes on the Veg platter:

And also photograph the list of these dishes:

But while doing that, I was startled to realize that they tried to mesmerize their lentils before they realized they could only marinate them:

Perhaps the mesmerizing part would be useful when giving the patrons the bill...
