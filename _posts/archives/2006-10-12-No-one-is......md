Funny thing...NO ONE is a political animal. Every single person "doesn't like people games"...can't deal with power ploys....is not fond of scoring points and having manipulative game plans...then where does the politics come from? No one ever says, "Yes, I enjoy the cut-and-thrust type of conversation, I enjoy asserting my dominance, I enjoying using people, their egos, foibles and insecurities to further my goals and aims"....Even politicians do not admit that they are politcal persons!

It is mostly amusing to watch the political overtones in meetings and conversations; but every now and then, one has to take a stand on what one believes in, and be drawn into the politics oneself!

We have a saying in Bengal where I grew up...if there&nbsp;are two&nbsp;Bengalis, there is one Durga Puja. If there are three Bengalis, there are two Durga Pujas! And I think&nbsp;this &nbsp;applies universally....
