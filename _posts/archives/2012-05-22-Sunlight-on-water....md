As I walk in the morning, I often find the sprinklers on in various homes, and sometimes, in the early morning sunlight, they look utterly beautiful...

The light plays through the water drops like a mischieveous child with her family...and they, too, reflect the light each in their own way....

I am going to post an album of "light-and-water" pics as a Facebook album, will give the link when I finish.....right now, I have an incredibly joyful task ahead of me...
