Someone I know has not been able to walk for the past few days. (Tests are being done; it's not a paralysis, thankfully, but the problem persists.)

Amazing, one might be healthy in every other way, but a lack of mobility turns one's life upside down...one is totally dependent on others for so many small and large things, just going to the toilet is impossible and that dreadful thing, the bedpan, looms large in one's life...

Good health is a great, great blessing. I exercise, not to look good, but to have good health and physical independence.
