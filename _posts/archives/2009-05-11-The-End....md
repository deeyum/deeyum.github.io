Someone sent me a terse email, with just these few words: "we are NOT friends". No background, no CLUE what happened so suddenly. No explanations, nothing....nothing...

It's happened a few times with others in the past, but GOD it hurts. MUST not let it hurt...of course I can get over these things.

I must understand that MY being close to someone is not the same as THEIR being close to me. Imagine, I am still unable to learn this simple fact.


"dOst dOst nA rahA...pyAr pyAr nA rahA...zindagi, hamEin thErA aitbAr nA rahA...."

Well, there are friends and family around, and the wound may stop bleeding soon.
