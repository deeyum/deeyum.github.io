Here's the radiant bride:

The handsome groom:

And one of the ceremonies (in Aryan culture, the important one) that makes them husband and wife:

pANi grahaNam ("acceptance of the hand")

(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viv%C4%81ha"> the wedding rituals </a> )

the bride's hand,holding a sacred coconut and betel leaves, is placed in that of her father, and then placed in the groom's hand...the bride's mother then pours sanctified water over it...as the water pours from the bride's hand to the groom's, her care and welfare passes from her father to her husband.
