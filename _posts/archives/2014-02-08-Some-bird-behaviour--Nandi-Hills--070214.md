Our visit to Nandi Hills provided me a great opportunity to watch several birds' behaviour. I found that several birds, such as the Orange-throated Thrush, or this

PUFF-THROATED BABBLER

forage amongst the dead leaves, turning them over to get at the insects:

Birds such as the

NILGIRI WOOD PIGEON

are more shy and keep to the tree canopy:

Other birds forage along the pathways. I'd never previously seen a


TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER

do the same thing. He only flew away when some visitors approached too close, and was not disturbed by our prescence at all.

It's wonderful to be able to spend a little time, watching these beauties and not have to rush off. so..it was a productive, enjoyable morning at Nandi Hills.
