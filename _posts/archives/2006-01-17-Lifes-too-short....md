There are so many things to do, so much to learn....I wish I could be like the people who find an interest and focus on it intensely and are always associated with it....but for me, everything is fascinating. Travelling to places near and far, I become interested in the history of a place and wish I could be in archaeology or a historian; when I look at <LJ user="kalyan">'s or <LJ user= "yathin">'s photos, I would love to live all my life in the forests; when Arun Pai called me up this afternoon, I felt that I must go immediately on his walks and learn more about the city I live in and love; when I hear a good concert on the radio, I wish I were a better musician. I love languages, but real proficiency in many of those I know still eludes me. I wish I could learn at the speed of light...and retain that learning forever. I would love to be an artist, a writer, a musician, a counsellor (I find people of all types compellingly interesting) a good cook.... a sakala kalaa valli!

The Tiger Census seemed to fade out of probability when I realized that we should have reported at Nagarhole this morning...however, a call to the Asst Conservator of Forests has reassured us that even for 3 days, we will be welcome as volunteers, and we are now planning to go to Kabini on Wednesday. Since we are a little too soft for sleeping bags in the jungle, we would probably stay either at Kapila Resort or the Jungle Lodges Resort...the way the tiger census is being described, I don't really think
we are going to see any tigers, though! We do hope it will be a good learning experience....

BTW it would be very funny if we did meet a tiger and it ate us up and people looked at the title of my last blog entry!
