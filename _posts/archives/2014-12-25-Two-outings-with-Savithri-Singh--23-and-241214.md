Email to the bngbirds egroup:

The visit of an avid birder and a friend from Delhi, Savithri Singh, meant a couple of birding outings, one to the zoo area on the 23rd of December, 2014. (Kartik, Karuna, Savithri, and I.) 

 This visit was curtailed as I had forgotten that the zoo would be closed on Tuesdays, and Flycatcher Avenue, being now in the ticketed area, would not be accessible. We birded in the orchard area and returned reasonably satisfied with our morning. observing Lark behaviour and the flight of Rosy Starlings. I also got to see the Rufous-tailed Lark in the orchard area after a long time. I wish I'd been able to take Savithri to show her Flycatcher Avenue and Kingfisher Pond...but that will be next time! We took a drive along the Reserve Forest on the Bannerghatta Kaggalipura Road, too, up to the Bhavani temple, but the Kingfishers eluded us there, too.

However, Savithri's wish to sight the Tickell's Blue Flycatcher came to fruition on the 24th, when  a group of us ( Brinda, Kartik, Karuna, Kiran, Savithri, Sharmila and I)  went to Nandi Hills. Though the Nursery area was rather sparse on sightings (more photographers/birders than birds!), enough birds obliged us to keep us very happy. One of the highlights was sighting both the Red-breasted Flycatcher and the Red-throated Flycatcher, the differences between which I came home and read about.  My post about this beauty is at

(All my pics were of Ficedula parva,  and none of  F. albicilla! I've also included a short video of its call.)

The Blue-capped Rock Thrush put in a very brief appearance at the 'water leak puddle" near Tipu's summer lodge, but thereafter, the hordes of visitors seemed to keep it away. We followed a pair of Puff-throated Babblers around the entrance to the Nursery area, and into the broken shed of potted plants there. Bird photography can be "potty" work sometimes!

The Pied Thrush and the Nilgiri Wood Pigeon eluded us, I am afraid, as did many of the raptors. But an Asian Paradise Flycatcher did its Ribbon-tailed  Flaunty Dance in the area near the Monkey-Puzzle tree near the summer lodge, the Auricaria cookii tree opposite the water reservoir, and again at the Nehru Nilaya. We were happy with our morning as we headed home.

Up next, my quick "bird-butter" trail to Valley school this morning (Christmas Day), after the disappointment of having to cancel the volunteer trip to Bandipur.  That will have a bird and butterfly list!

Cheers, and hope everyone is enjoying the long weekend and the festive time!
