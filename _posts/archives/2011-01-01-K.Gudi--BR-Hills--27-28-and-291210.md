It was lovely to be able to introduce our family to the forests of Karnataka, even though the driving had them scared stiff at times...people from the US can't cope with unruly traffic...they are too used to ruly conditions :)

What better way to start on the trip  than with the sunrise in the fields on our way out....?

<lj-cut text="images from the trip">


We crossed over the Arkavathi Bridge, too:

We took a brief detour to see Sivansamudram Falls, where the flow was much less than when I visited in November:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9066.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9066.jpg" border="0" alt="us at svnsnmdrm 271210"></a>

We reached the JLR resort at K.Gudi to find a festive green star on top of the Gol Ghar:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9096.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9096.jpg" border="0" alt="grn str 271210"></a>

We went to settle down in the tents, but I was also tickled by the "Lo ghut"!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9109.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9109.jpg" border="0" alt="lo ghut 271210"></a>

Some of the 

WILD BOAR 

 around the campus are quite used to humans, and I caught a particularly human lazy-bones look on the face of this one. He seems to have come straight out of the Asterix comics!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9137.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9137.jpg" border="0" alt="boar 271210"></a>

On our safaris, we saw a lot of 

BARKING DEER:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9150.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9150.jpg" border="0" alt="barking dr 271210"></a>

several 

GAUR

or wild bison:

Here's the radio in the jeep, through which the drivers communicate with each other about interesting sightings:

Near the campus was a beautiful

SAUSAGE TREE (Kigelia pinnata)

...you can see how it got its name!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9404.jpg" border="0" alt="kigelia fruit 281210"></a>

Here are the  beautiful flowers of the tree:

There were a pair of majestic

BRAHMINY KITES

at the water body near the campus:

On one safari we saw this 

RED SPURFOWL:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9273.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9273.jpg" border="0" alt="red sprfwl 281210"></a>


<lj-embed id="601"/>




The next day, we also visited the Biligiri Rangana Temple:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9431.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9431.jpg" border="0" alt="brt 281210"></a>

Here are some of us:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9417.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9417.jpg" border="0" alt="us at brt 281210"></a>


My niece and nephew were thrilled by the antics of the 

BONNET MACAQUES

(of the huge group that were Kalyan's great friends at the JLR resort, only four are present now!)


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9419.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9419.jpg" border="0" alt="monkey 281210"></a>

Here's a mother with a tiny baby:

We enjoyed the spectacle of one of them doing acrobatics in order to eat the fruit of the 

JACKFRUIT 

tree:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9464.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9464.jpg" border="0" alt="jackfruit etg 281210"></a>


<lj-embed id="602"/>

Moving a little up the evolutionary ladder, I photographed this devotee with the 'nAmam'on his forehead:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9420.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9420.jpg" border="0" alt="naamam 281210"></a>


We saw several

CHITAL (Spotted Deer)

during the safaris, including this magnificently-antlered stag:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9290.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9290.jpg" border="0" alt="stg antlr 281210"></a>

After the temple, we also went to visit

Gorukana

and I was very happy to meet Jadeswamy and Ganesh. Here's Ganesh:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9485.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9485.jpg" border="0" alt="ganesh 281210"></a>

And I was really thrilled when Ganesh told me that Dr. Sudarshan was actually there, and introduced me to him! I instantly asked Ganesh (who is an excellent photographer) to snap me with him!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9484.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9484.jpg" border="0" alt="dr sudarshan 281210"></a>

Ganesh showed us around the campus, and I caught these mating

COTTON STAINER BUGS:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9494.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9494.jpg" border="0" alt="c s bugs 281210"></a>

Ganesh also talked about the tiger that had been active around the area, and showed us this pugmark:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9496.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9496.jpg" border="0" alt="pug mark gorukana 281210"></a>

Back at the JLR campus, I wandered around, and got this beautiful

LESSER YELLOWNAPE (thanks, Ramit)

pecking with its beak, and red tongue, at the wood:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9532.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9532.jpg" border="0" alt="s t wdpckr 291210"></a>

In the faint light, I also managed to get a 

BLACK-HOODED ORIOLE:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9537.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9537.jpg" border="0" alt="hood orle 291210"></a>

We saw several 

ELEPHANTS 

on the safaris, and were able to observe their behaviour for a while:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9553.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9553.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

<lj-embed id="603"/>


On one safari, we sighted the 

BLACK-FACED LANGUR

leaping across the tree-tops:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9611.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9611.jpg" border="0" alt="langur 291210"></a>

And in a pond, between VGKK and K. Gudi, we sighted these

POND TERRAPINS:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9082.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9082.jpg" border="0" alt="terrapin 281210"></a>

Of course, I can't resist also including this

LION

at the Mysore Palace!

Some of the deer at the campus, too, are used to humans:

Let me close with these sunset pics, which give the appearance of the forest on fire!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9211.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9211.jpg" border="0" alt="sunset 271210"></a>


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9559.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9559.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

All in all, it was a very satisfying trip, though our family was rather disappointed at not sighting tigers or leopards. Since all the trails except one have been shut down by the Forest Department, I did not see this as likely to happen..and it didn't. However, I told them that our post-dusk sighting of a Civet Cat was a rarer one than a sighting of a tiger!

I do hope that they open up the trails before I visit BR Hills again....
