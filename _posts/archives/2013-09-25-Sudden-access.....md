Do not be put off by any short-and-terse comments I am making on your LJ post.

Today, suddenly, I am able to not only access friends' pages but also comment on them, and reply to comments on my own posts.

But not knowing how long it will last (yes, the acess is already gone, that's why I am posting this), I simply rush to make a one-word comment and then go on to the next friend's page or the friend's next page....so please forgive the brevity!

<LJ user="pondhopper">, I was in the middle of one of your posts when access shut off :)
