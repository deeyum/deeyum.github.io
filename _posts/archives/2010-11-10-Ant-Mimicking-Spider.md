One gets to see things in the most unexpected places. I went to see a 11-day-old baby, and I found this...Prashanth pointed it out to me in a plant that was in a flower-pot!

At first sight, this looks like a weaver ant carrying another; it's only when you look closely, and count the legs, that you realize it's a spider!


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mimicry"> here is the wiki </a>

about ant-mimicry; apparently many creatures mimic ants! 


A delightful and unexpected episode; thank you, <LJ user="prashanthks">! Alas, the spider was moving too fast for me to get any good shots.
