Though the symptoms (painful rash, sore throat, fever) that made the docs suspect endocarditis, have still not gone, the mitral valve infection has been ruled out, tests have shown that D's heart and lungs are in excellent shape, and he's come home from the hospital...YAYYYYYY!


I am relieved...and happy...I always feel that health is the only parameter that I truly worry about, for loved ones!

I went to Bandipur yesterday (didn't feel like sitting at home waiting for the test results) and the beauty of the monsoon clouds amongst the truly blue mountains of the Nilgiri ranges was breath-taking...photos will never do justice to it, but still, will post some. <lj user="asakiyume">, get ready!
