A wonderful bird is the pelican...
His bill can hold more than his belican.
He can take in his beak
Food enough for a week...
But Iâ€™m damned if I see how the helican!

(Dixon Merritt)

That was one pelican in Forest Park, filling up! 

I love limericks.

Here's a limerick about a limerick:

It's partly the shape of the thing
That gives the limerick its swing.
Those accordion pleats
Full of airy conceits
Take it up like a kite on the wing.

(yes, Photobucket is working again. Big grin.)
