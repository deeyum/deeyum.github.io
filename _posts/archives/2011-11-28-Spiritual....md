...a fun forum to post wildlife-related photographs on!


was "spirituality", and this is what I posted:


Is there anything more spiritual
Than the soaring of a bird?

The heart soars like the bird, as we behold...
We feel it...we do not need to be told
What "spiritual" is.
It's happiness...joy...bliss.

It was a difficult choice, as almost everything in Nature makes me feel spiritual....I call a visit to Bannerghatta a visit to a temple!
