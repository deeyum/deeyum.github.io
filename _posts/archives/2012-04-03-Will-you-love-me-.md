Naayaki naayakanidam irunthu piriyum pozhuthu sonnathu:


Naan unnai pirinthirukkum pozhuthu
Ennai ninaippaayaa?
En vaarthaigalin ethiroliyum
Un kaathil naan sonna kaathalum...
Ketkaamal pogumaa?
Un manathil irukkum soonyatthai
Niraitthu viduvaayaa?
Naan irunthathai 
Ennik kolvaayaa?
Naan thirumbum varai
Nee kaathiruppaayaa?


Rough translation:

When the naayaki (heroine) is going far away from the naayakan (hero).

Will you think of me
When I am separated from you?
Will the echo of my words,
My love,whispered in your ear,
Grow faint?
When you are faced with emptiness
Will you fill it up?
Will you remember those times
When I was there?
Will you wait
Until I return?

Has love ever changed, over the millenia? The need for two people to be together is probably the most powerful emotion of all, perhaps only exceeded by the love of a mother for her child.
I'll write about that next....but meanwhile, Gir, which I have never visited before, beckons! It will be blisteringly hot. I wish I'd chosen a trip to the Himalaya instead :)
