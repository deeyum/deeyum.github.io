Hi Everyone, 

In the chill pre-dawn, 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15783551116" title="IMG_5369 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7549/15783551116_2482c9e83f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5369"></a>

a group of us met up at Shoppers' Stop, and after the MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop) at Bannerghatta Circle, where we introduced ourselves, we proceeded to Hulimangala.

Even before looking for the birds, the majestic trees of the avenue there had their usual awe-inspiring efffect on us. We looked up to see the many nests of the Parakeets, the Mynahs and other birds. 

The Lantana and Eupatorium weeds yielded Prinias and a Booted Warbler, but of course, when the Mottled Wood Owl made its dramatic appearance,being mobbed by a group of Drongos,

there were "ooohs" and "aahs" from everyone, with craned necks and pointing fingers!

After a while, we moved to the water body on the other side, which also yielded many species of waterfowl. It was also thrilling to see some raptors.

An excellent sighting was that of Geetanjali and Subir Dhar who, in the middle of pressing family business, came to see how we were doing!

I was very happy to see Soham and Chinmayi ...we must have more children in our groups! Birders...do bring along your children and introduce them to the wonderful world of birds and nature.

We all came back to our cars, shared some delicious snacks, and dispersed. Some of us had breakfast at Upahara Banashree.

 Gayatri and I went with Arun to see the Nagareshwara (Pancha linga) temple at Begur, and here, the lake nearby delighted us with 2o+ Spot-billed Pelicans as well as other waterfowl.
