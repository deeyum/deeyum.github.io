Reading...is such an amazing thing, when you think about it. Just imagine a series of marks giving one information, passing on ideas, firing one's inspiration, evoking strong emotions, tickling one's sense of humour, arousing one's imagination, eliciting memories...reading may give the same information to every reader, but the pictures it evokes in one's mind, the thoughts that it brings about, the imagination that it results in, is different to each person who reads!

So introducing a child to reading, too, is a magical thing, and it's lovely to see this mother, parked on a busy street, taking the time off to read from the book to her toddler! The scene captured my fancy....
