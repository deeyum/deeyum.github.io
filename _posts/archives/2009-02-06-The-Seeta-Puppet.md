Seeta lies,ignored and broken.
She is, no more, the heroine, the centre of the action.
Separated from Rama, she has no value.
She is in a foreign land now;
Another man has tried to possess her.
The hero is her husband
Who will come to this country to wage war on her abductor
To redeem his own valour and his wife's honour.
Then, he will smirch that honour by refusing to accept her
Unless she walks through fire.
Perhaps the puppet thinks of all this
As she lies, and does not wish to get up again
And take up the role of the subjugated, the doubted, the helpless woman
Who is idolized and yet oppressed.
