If anyone thinks traffic in Bangalore is bad, they should try travelling by car in Mumbai. We are staying in the Peddar Road area, the wedding we wanted to attend was at Chembur, and we visited someone at Andheri....neither of us wants to go back for the reception now!

But the concrete roads of Mumbai impress me...

More later, I am on very slow Reliance wireless connection on KM's laptop...we are within walking distance of Haji Ali and the Mahalakshmi temple, so off for a nice sea-face walk now (it was lovely in the morning, too.)
