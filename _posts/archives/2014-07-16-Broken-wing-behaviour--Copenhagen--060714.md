Broken-wing behaviour (or

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction_display"> Distraction Display </a>

 is a very interesting phenomenon in the bird world. Usually, the bird "acts" as if one wing is broken, to decoy predators from a nest, or fledglings, nearby. When the creature that is the perceived threat approaches quite close, the bird suddenly "regains" the use of the lame wing and flies off.

I have observed one demonstration of broken-wing behaviour which was very unusual, and for which I have never got an explanation. A female Koel tried this behaviour when she was trying to get into the nest of a couple of Coppersmith Barbets. This was in my favourite haunt...Flycatcher Avenue at Bannerghatta Zoo area.

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/505970.html"> Here </a>

is my account of what happened, and here is the pic of the female Koel displaying her "lame" wing:

I still do not know what the female Koel wished to achieve by this, but I enjoyed watching the drama.

I also watched an Oriental Magpie Robin exhibiting this behaviour once in Thattekkad, and a Kildeer in St.Louis, Missouri, decoying a cat from her nest.

But...little did I expect to have this behaviour shown to me in the middle of a crowded marina, in Copenhagen, of all places! But as we (<LJ user="prashanthchengi">, <LJ user="kejn">, and I) walked towards the water, I was surprised to see a Blue Rock Pigeon sitting on the ground, quite close to the visitors, with one apparently broken wing.

"Oh!" exclaimed my friend, "Poor bird, its wing is broken." "No," I responded, "It's not!" and as I clicked, I continued to move closer to the pigeon. I moved closer and closer...and still the bird did not move. Was I wrong, perhaps, in my idea? My friend repeated, "It IS broken, you are going so near it..."

Oh, no, I was perfectly right, after all...impressing my friend no end with my "knowledge of nature" (heh, heh!) , the bird flew off on two perfectly good wings! It then went further by teaming up with this strutting white pigeon.

 I don't know if they are a couple, or a sorority...

But that pigeon with her acting certainly delighted my friend no end, and I hope the bird ensured the safety of the nest, or fledglings...or whatever it was we were getting distracted from!

So...I went to see Copenhagen as a tourist, but wound up with a welcome spot of birding behaviour!
