Missed meeting <lj user="pondhopper"> by just about thirty miles, a few hours...and

on their part, a lot of tiredness after a long drive, and  on mine, not having transportation to go out to meet them.

By the time I had the transportation, it was too late and they were already tired from the long drive from Michigan...as D says, it wasn't meant to happen now; we'll do it in the future!
