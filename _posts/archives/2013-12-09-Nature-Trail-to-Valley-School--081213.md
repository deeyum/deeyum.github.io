Here's my email to the Bird Watchers' Field Club:

It was a bracing Sunday morning as 10 of us headed out to the Valley School area. As usual, it did not disappoint us...the highlights of the morning were watching, riveted, as large groups of Coppersmith Barbets and Oriental White-eyes feasted on the Banyan figs on the tree at the entrance.

 Also, a flock of Scaly-breasted Munias, Silverbills, and Rose-ringed Parakeets were feasting off the maize in the morning light...an  a"maizing" sight that we thoroughly enjoyed!

We met many other birders and photographers on the trail, too.

Chandu and I watched a Warbler sitting on the wire  near two Red-rumped Swallows. Is this usual behaviour for the bird? I am so used to peering into the leaf-clutter for these skulky little LBJ's, that it was quite a surprise.

Ipomaeia muricata

The Flycatchers gave us a whole cultural program. The Asian Paradise did his tail-fashion show, the Fantail  performed their dance, and the Tickell's Blue sang its sweet song for us!

Except for the Shama and the Kestrel, all of us saw all the birds, strengthening my theory that if we approach carefully, and are mindful of others' need to sight the birds, large groups can have as productive birding trips as small ones.

Having said that....we did split up into smaller groups at times.

Shield Bug.

I was very happy to have two young botanists, Janani and Ganesh along, as I learnt a bit from them about various plants and seeds we saw on the way.

It was even more enjoyable to compare notes and images over IVC (Iddli Vada Coffee) at Udupi Banashree on the way back.
