Posting from Picasa to Blogger is much easier than posting to Flickr first and then posting to LJ....so here's the photo of the sunset at the St Louis Zoo:

I notice that cross-posts from Blogger to LJ get truncated...but I hope that the photo can be viewed properly since it is on Blogger! No, it doesn't display the photo as well as the text, no doubt I don't have the hang of posting yet....you have to click on the "11.35 am" (the time given for the post) to see the pic.

Oh all ye geeks out there...tell me how to do this properly!!
