I have been sketching all my life; and it is so much a part of me that I have never thought much about it. When I moved into my present apartment, I finally decided to frame a few of the sketches that had been autographed, and a few that I liked...but that was about the limit of it.

I tend to sketch mainly when I am stuck indoors because of the heat. (Cold weather allows me to wear extra clothes and stride off happily.) I do not even have an easel or a special set of pencils...

But if I knew that posting a picture of a sketch would bring in the compliments like this...I would have taken it a lot more seriously...

I will be posting more of my sketches now...in sketching, I love the way a few lines can indicate so much of form and content!

Thank you for the compliments, all of you...I feel so happy; that tiger-sketch entry is going to be one of my treasured ones!
