.....

My neighbour's friend and her sister came over just now (yes, in flats they come over even at midnight...well, to be fair, my lights were on and they wanted something rather urgently) and we were talking...and I talked about it being World Procastination Day....oooh, that lady, so sweetly, said, "Oh, do they still procastinate little children? I thought they did it only for animals...maybe some Muslims and Christians (she meant Jews I suppose) do it..."

I was thrilled...just waited for them to leave so I could rush to my LJ and post it...

I am reminded of the Sardarji whose job interview went extremely well until he was asked to show his testimonials.
