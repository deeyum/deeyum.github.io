Meeting people...it's something I love to do, and this weekend has been fantastic for it! 

Yesterday was the annual

<a href="http://www.indianaturewatch.in"> INW </a>

meet at Mysore, and it was great to go in a fun-loving group, and meet a lot of old and new friends on this wildlife photography forum....even though the death of 

<a href="http://www.hindu.com/2010/09/18/stories/2010091858430600.htm">a noted musician and scholar, Pandit Puttaraja Gavai </a>
 cancelled our proposed birding trip to Ranganathittu, (all the lakes in Mysore and Zoo were also closed)  it was well worth the trip to Mysore.We meandered back to Bangalore, stopping here and there to see whatever birds we spotted, and constantly pulling each other's legs!

This morning, too, 11 of us met up opposite my home, and want for the 3rd Sunday bngbirds birding trip, to the Bannerghatta forest area. This time we had some very special visitors...the Amstutzes, all the way from Crane Creek, El Portal, Yosemite National Park, California. It was fun to meet up with both the NTP group, as well as both new and old friends from the bngbirds group....some of them were excellent at spotting, and our sightings were varied...and wonderful. 

The trip lasted much longer than I'd usually budget....and then several of us went to Adigas' for brunch, and I persuaded all the breakfasters to come home, too....we all sat and laughed and joked together, and I am now sitting in an empty home, wishing it weren't empty. I am, usually, a person content with my own company as much as with others'....but just now, I miss the laughter and fullness and the joy that a house full of people brings.

Friends...the greatest treasure in the world.
