on the 10th of September, 20016.

L to R, Hariharan IS, Chandu Bandi, his son Krishna Virat, Aravind A M, Janhvi Vyas, and Rishov Biswas, who took the chattering band of children (there were about 80, plus 6 teachers to keep them in some semblance of order!) on the path around the lake. It was very kind of my friends to volunteer, as they always do!

We sighted a fair amount of birds, because the waterfowl are generally to be found at the lake all day, and we did have good sightings of the woodland birds, too, in the bushes around the banks.

Some of the children did a great job of keeping bird lists, a good field-trip activity:

Bithi (on the right in this photo) organized a lot of things, including having the restrooms opened up for the children.
