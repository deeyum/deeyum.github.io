Movie stars...are often known for their beauty, and less often, for their histrionic talent.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suchitra_Sen"> Suchitra Sen </a>

had a combination of both...in the Bengali film world, she was called "mahAnAyikA" or "the great heroine" (a politically incorrect word today, but it's more precise.) Her foray into the Hindi film world was not as successful...but she acted in some great movies, and I always associate her with some of the most lilting songs I know.
If you want to watch one of her movies, inspired by the life of Indira Gandhi, here:

And another one, also dealing with a relationship that has broken:

"su chitra", literally means, "good picture"...to me, Suchitra Sen will remain the good picture of beauty and talent combined. I will not forget her.
