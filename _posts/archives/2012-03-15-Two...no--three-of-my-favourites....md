Franz Lizst is a composer whose works (I mean, those that I know of!)I like...and one of my great favourites is this wonderful cartoon of Tom and Jerry, which uses Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, S.244/2, the second in a set of 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies...the others are, alas, not very well-known.

Imagine the creativity that lets animation and all those visual gags, be set to the strict time-frame of the rhapsody.....

Many Tom'n'Jerry cartoons won Academy Awards, and they deserved them....these cartoons date back to the 40's, I think.
