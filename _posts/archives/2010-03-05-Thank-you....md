I got so many supportive messages in reponse to my post of self-doubt and uncharacteristic negativity...and

sent me the link to this great speech:

I listened to it, and am so much cheered (er, I didn't want that inspirational song repeated though!)...I'll be seeing this whenever I'm feeling down.

Thank you...to each of you who responded. It was just what the doctor ordered.
