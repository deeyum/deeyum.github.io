<H2 class=date-header>August 26, 2005</H2><DIV class=entry id=entry-6159138><H3 class=entry-header>International Blog Day 2005</H3><DIV class=entry-content><DIV class=entry-body><P><A href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/blogthis.jpg"><IMG class=image-full title=Blogthis style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" alt=Blogthis src="http://rconversation.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/blogthis.jpg" border=0></A></P><P>The idea came from Israeli blogger <A href="http://niro.typepad.com/"><FONT color=#003366>Nir Ofir</FONT></A>, who happened to notice that the numbers for the 31st of August, "3108" (which is how they order dates pretty much everywhere <EM>except</EM> the U.S.) look kind of like the word "blog"...close enough, right? Anyway here's the plan to celebrate World Blog Day 2005: </P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>In one long moment on August 31st, bloggers from all over the world will post a recommendation of 5 new Blogs, Preferably, Blogs different from their own culture, point of view and attitude. On this day, blog surfers will find themselves leaping and discovering new, unknown Blogs, celebrating the discovery of new people and new bloggers.



What a ridiculous reason to choose 31 August....!<!-- sidebar2 --></P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV>
