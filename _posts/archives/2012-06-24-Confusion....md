Sometimes, the mind says one thing
But the heart another.
"Don't go!" says the mind,
"Don't listen to my brother.
"He talks from the middle,
"I talk from the top;
"He may egg you onwards,
"But I ask you to stop."
Whose pull should I heed?
Whose advice to take?
Which is the course of action
That will not result in a mistake?
