I did a whole lot of very interesting stuff today, including photographing our Chief Minister overseeing the funeral procession of someone who died in the blasts and this was NOT a sad thing...how, you ask? Wait for a few days, and all will be revealed in <a href="www.citizenmatters.in"> Citizen Matters </a>.....

But I was waiting in the morning to begin the photowalk with Mahesh Shantaram and the group, and I shot these really lovely leaves-in-the-hedge....
