It was a quick, and unplanned recording....to let her hear how I sang it, so don't expect any really good stuff!

Here are the beautiful words that made me sing:


Para-amnesia

I woke, and even recognizing the room
Didn't know where I was
Even repeating my name
Didn't know who I was.
I wandered down a path
Familiar only as dreams are
Whose next turn I could not predict
Though when I found myself
At last at a seashore
Of round gray stones,
I nodded, sure
That this was my destination.
