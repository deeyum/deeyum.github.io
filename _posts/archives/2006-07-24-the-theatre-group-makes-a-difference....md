....

A couple of weeks ago, watched a Monty Python spoof and a Hamlet spoof by a local theatre group, which made a foul play of it...yesterday, watched Evam of Chennai do the same thing...it had me laughing uncontrollably! Evam is a very professional group, their comic timing is excellent, and they ad lib superbly too. What a difference the production makes! We had a great evening, and came home with our spirits lifted...nice to laugh like this once in a while!
