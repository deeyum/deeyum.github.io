Another of my eternal favourites....this time of love returned...what a voice Lata has, it gives me goose-pimples as I write this.

Ap kee nazrOn nEy samjhA
pyAr kEy kAbil mujhEy
dil ki aey dhadkan ttheher jA
mil gayee manzil mujhEy


jee,humEyn manzoor hei
Ap kA yeh faislA
keh rahee hai hur naZar
banthA parvar shukriyA
has kEy apnee zindagee mein
kar liyA shhAmil mujhEy



Ap kee manzil hoon meyn
mEri manzil Ap hain
kyoon mein thoofAn sEy daroon
merA sAhil Ap hain
kOyee thoofAnOn sEy keh dEy
mil gayA sAhil mujhEy


pad gayee dil par merEy
Ap kee parchAyinyAn
har tharaf bajnEy lagee
sainkdOn shehnAyiyAn
dO jahAn kee Aj khushiyAn hO gayee hAsil mujhEy


Translation

Your eyes consider me
Worthy of love
Oh, my heartbeat, stop:
I have found my destination


Yes-('jee' is also an honorific way of addressing someone)I am agreeable
To this decision of yours
Each glance says
God, thank you!
With a smile, into your life
You brought me

I am your goal
and you are mine
Why should I be afraid of the storm 
You are my shore (where the boat of life comes ultimately to rest)
Let someone tell the storms
That I have found my shore


On my heart has fallen
Your shadow:
In every direction, has started the playing 
Of millions of "shehnAi" (wind instrument used at weddings)
The joys of two worlds
Are mine today....



I love singing both these songs, and each time I know how far short of perfect my rendition is, and I try to improve! I was planning to post my rendition on Evoca, but realized that the original would be far better.


The heroine is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mala_Sinha"> Mala Sinha </a> and the hero is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmendra">  Dharmendra </a>, often called "Garam Dharam" (Hot Dharam) because of his good looks and his interesting private life!

I have started hunting for Indian poetry and music...I think I am ready to go back home....! ;)
