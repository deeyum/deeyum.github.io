On Sunday, DnA decided to treat me to a short (short because of GD) hike in Castlewood State Park....and the Park reminded me SO much of the Bannerghatta area that I go to with Geetanjali and co, that I was quite homesick for a bit! One great plus was that there was NO plastic, and one great minus was that there were NO little chai-stalls giving hot little thimble-chais, so delicious and giving us that hot-mouthful boost...

Here's the scenery; that's the Meramec River (we went to see the

once, and

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/168533.html"> very beautiful they are, too!</a> )

<lj-cut text="some more images from Sunday">

Here's the River Trail at the park...it's so reminiscent of the paths we walk through on our birding and wildlife trips...

Here's the sign for the State Park:

We met up with a cyclist with his mountain terrain bike...

The only bird which I managed to get a (foozly) photograph of, was this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downy_Woodpecker"> DOWNY WOODPECKER </a>

rat-tatting away on the wood, in true Woody Woodpecker fashion:

DnA are checking that GD is comfortable in her sling:

And GD is ensuring that she has an eye out for everything and doesn't miss the view:

Miniature flowers put little molecules of sunshine on some plants:

Unknown little fruits looked red and juicy in the grass:

A tree had decorated itself with mushrooms:

They were frilly,delicately-coloured creations:

The grass bent its head to see where it had sprung from:

Spiders had spun their gossamer over the leaves:

The only three insects that I got on camera (perish the thought of any mammals!) were at the home of DnA's friends; here's a spider bunching itself up, trying to spin a web:

I caught it as it swung past the bottom of the hammock-post:

I didn't compensate enough for the way the harsh afternoon sun would wash out this horrific-looking insect:

But this delicate dragonfly (it looks like our PIED PADDYFIELD SKIMMER back home) cast a shadow as delicate as the patterned gauze of its wings, upon the leaf on which it sat...

Coming home, I got this lovely vista of a church, from behind D's shoulder:

A rolling stone gathers no....

but I did gather a lot of lovely mental images of that short outing!
