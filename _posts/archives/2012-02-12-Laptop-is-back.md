Woohoo the relief of being able to TYPE properly again...!

The laptop connects to the wifi now, though the intial problem (losing my passwords to Facebook and WordPress) continues....

Since I am leaving to catch a train in half an hour, I'll come back from Nannaj and post pictures....I promise....including a beautiful baby Long-billed Vulture...

Meanwhile...enjoy your weekend, everyone, while I enjoy mine!
