Yesterday, at Barbecue Nation, I spotted this very diplomatic drink:

Probably, it will give you a hint that you shouldn't have the next one?

And it's nice when your friends display the same sense of humour that you have....we were looking at the Glass House in Lalbagh this morning,and spotted this dog right next to the little statue of Nandi, the Divine Bull.... when N remarked, "That's a Bull Dog"!

I enjoyed that very much.
