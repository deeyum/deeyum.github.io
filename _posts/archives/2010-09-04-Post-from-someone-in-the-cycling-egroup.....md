"...rode to Pearl Valley where the monkeys stole
what little food that we had carried.Went to the hotel that opened at
10:30 and had breakfast.Came out to meet the RVCE group that had just
arrived,and to find that our bikes had been butchered by the monkeys.

Report:
1.K:Rear Half of the Saddle Eaten.
2.San:Front Half of the Saddle Eaten.
3.Sam:2 cuts on the saddle and handlebar tape ripped out.
4.A:No Damage
5.Sas:No Damage.
6.N:They shat out the saddles they ate on his bike."


I am still laughing hard...
