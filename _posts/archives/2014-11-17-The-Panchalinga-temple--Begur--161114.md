Sometimes a lot of the hard work is done for me!

Arvind took Gayatri and me to the 1200-year-old temple of nagarEshwara in Begur. I thought I'd write about it, but

<a href="http://www.anitabora.com/blog/2008/05/05/a-hamlet-steeped-in-history-begur/"> this blogpost by Anita Bora </a>

has done a great job of it!

The only difference after 6.5 years is that two rAja gOpurAs have been constructed, and will be consecrated today (17 Nov 2014). There are some rather unimaginative, but well-meaning, repairs in the temple, but the age old nagarEshwara shrine is still rather tottery!


Lovely video with the commentary in Kannada:

So, here are a few pictures I took.

A temple I saw before the Panchalinga temple:

A view of the Panchalinga temple:

<lj-cut text="more images of an ancient temple">

The simple temple rathA (chariot) in a "garage" opposite the temple.

A rAjagOpurA under construction (it's supposed to be consecrated today, and seems nowhere near done!)

The other one, more finished:

How can I have a post without birding in it? A migratory Spot-billed Pelican soars over the temple (the Begur Lake is close by).

It's made of bamboo and bricks, earth-friendly materials instead of metal; looks rickety, but that's what the builders are working with!
