No matter how politely couched, no matter how much masked,  I think that the emotions that underlie any communication in writing cannot be mistaken. As much as positive emotions like love and happiness, negative emotions such as irritation,  disgust, anger  or hatred show through the text, and make themselves very clear. The actual words may not give offense, but the tone of the whole text can certainly do so.

It IS good to keep to the decencies of debate, and attack the argument, not the person making it...but whether the text shouts abuses or maintains a frigid politeness, the anger underlying what is written comes across clearly. Words can sing...or they can buzz like approaching bees, carrying their painful stings.

I think that when one writes, the face is visible through the mask...
