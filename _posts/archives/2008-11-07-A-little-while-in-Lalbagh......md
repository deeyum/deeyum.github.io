We had met at the Siddapura gate of Lalbagh to distribute some flyers for the <a href="http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/events/show/359-nama-raste"> walk </a> on Sunday, and decided that I would take along both the 20D and my MLC as well....a great decision, as it turned out! 

The morning light was just fantastic for photography, and I enjoyed the light on the grasses at the edge of the lake:

This photo is not a "good composition"; it flouts the "rule of thirds" and who knows how many other laws..but I like it, so here are the stand of ornamental palms on Lalbagh Lake, with their reflection:

I was also lucky to sight a PURPLE HERON at the lake:

It started moving slowly along the reeds, and that was another good opportunity:

An ASHY PRINIA sat quite comfortably in the bushes:

A SIGNATURE SPIDER also invited me to click (yes, I swear, it said, "sign here on the zigzag line for a photograph"!)

Have I ever mentioned how I feel about Lalbagh?.... :)
