Meaning (ROUGH translation!)

(she)

new experiences...I found in him...
wicked thoughts, that did not earlier...
cheeks that have become rough with the touch of golden hands...

(he)

she came to me,staggering...
I went to her, without telling her...
"shouldn't do that," she said,"my heart won't bear it,"
I gave her one myself, "that isn't enough," she said... 


new experiences...I found in her...

(she)

"what eyes!" he said, and came close...
"what a girl!" he said, and made up such stories...
"This won't change," he said; "it's only you from now on," he said
He gave me sight, "I'm by your side!" he said....

(he)


Her appearance, like a beautifully decorated chariot...
My thoughts, that embrace the pallu of her saree...
"Where?" she said; "Here!" I replied;
She came there, and we reached...somewhere...

(she)

It was cool like the mist, it was sweet like fruits...
It fell like rain, blossomed like flowers...
No sleep, no more yearning...
Until others saw us, there was no parting....




This song is supposedly a Western song adapted, but I am not able to find out anything on the net about it, or get the lyrics...can someone help with info about the original song, and the lyrics?

The song is absolutely fantastic; the sexual aspect of romantic love is so elegantly expressed.... but the idea of what, or who, is visually "sexy" seems to have undergone a sea-change! That actress looks quite fat by today's standards!
