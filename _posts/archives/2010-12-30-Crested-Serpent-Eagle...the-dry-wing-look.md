When, from the safari jeep, I first sighted this Crested "Shirt Pant" Eagle, I couldn't even understand what I was seeing...took me a few seconds to realize that the bird had its wing open this way!

Am quite busy with family and shopping and stuff right now.....it just doesn't do to try and do other things when family is visiting, and has a large number of to-dos on the list!

But....here are two images that I like....
