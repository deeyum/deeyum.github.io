Babies of any species, I find, are surrounded by the herd and they are always pushed to the back so that they are well-hidden from prying eyes. I have noticed this with macaques, elephants, gaur, chital, sambhar, boar...even at the St Louis Zoo,when we first went to visit the cheetahs, the mother casually stood so that the cubs were hidden behind her body.
