Looking forward very much to the trip to Kolkata, scene of my childhood, and then Darjeeling and Gangtok...will write in my impressions of how things have changed in the last 28 years since I traversed that path last!

Summer has set in in Bangalore...the jacaranda and the tabebuia trees are in full bloom and the roads (or what passes for them) are carpets of purple and yellow....

The flyover near our home is to be inaugurated (well, part of it, actually) this evening...more traffic jams while corrupt ministers come and try to take credit for what has been delayed beyond a year....

I HATE POLITICIANS. I HATE THE CORRUPTION IN THIS COUNTRY!
