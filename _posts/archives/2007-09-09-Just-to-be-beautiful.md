Some things are born
Just to be, and to be beautiful
They do not stay too long;
Permanence is not their trait.
And they do not make a show
Or drag our eyes to them.
But when we happen to see
Our eyes remain riveted.
Their beauty gently awakens something deep in our hearts
Which has no voice, but is very strong.
Tomorrow, this object  may not be:
But today, its beauty can move you to tears.

I just looked up in Bandipur, and there it was, this simple vine and flower...and I gave thanks for being sighted.
