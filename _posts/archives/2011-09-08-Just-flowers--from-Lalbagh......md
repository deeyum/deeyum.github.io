Instead of writing about Profound Thoughts and boring the bejeesus out of everyone else, I feel it would be better to post pictures of a few lovely flowers and inflorescences that I have seen lately!

These were all taken in Lalbagh, on Saturday, 030911.

Seems to be a kind of magnolia flower....I used this photo for  greeting some friends on their birthdays and wedding anniversaries :)

Here's a Zinnia, with some kind of Hopper on it:

This is called "Colville's Glory" and is in bloom right now, near the Siddapura Gate:

Just to clarify to the many people who ask me the difference between water liles and lotuses, here are the water lilies...

Here's a flower that grows directly out of the tree-trunk, which Karthik tells me is related to the Kigelia Pinnata (Sausage Tree):

Here's the Akasha Mallige (flowers of the Indian Cork Tree), that is also in full bloom everywhere now:
