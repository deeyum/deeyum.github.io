We may be going out of town again today, so here's wishing everyone a very happy Deepavali  or Dhanteras (the 13th day of the moon, dedicated to wealth!)(or Lakshmi  Puja .. or Kaali Pujo in Bengal)....

Many people begin a new year now, starting their business accounts afresh.

Several north Indians have a practice of playing cards (actually, 3-card poker) for money, throughout the night...it's their way of saluting Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. I suppose it is also a great reminder of how capriciously Lakshmi bestows her favours!
