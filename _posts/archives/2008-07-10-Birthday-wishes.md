Abbah, I finally remembered in time to post...

Happy birthday to <LJ user="amoghavarsha">. May he have Purity in his life always...and happiness and good health and prosperity and.....!



When I say "Amoghavarsha",there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoghavarsha"> this one </a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoghavarsha_II"> this one </a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoghavarsha_III"> this one </a>, and Amoghavarsha IV (AD 968 - 972)!

I mean  <a href="http://amoghavarsha.com/"> Amoghavarsha  V </a> , ruling from 1983 - present date...happy quarter century.

And "amogha varsha" also means "excellent rains", so here's a photo of raindrops for the photographer...

It's fun posting birthday wishes, I wish I could remember birthdays in time...
