It was Sunday, and I was leaving for Linkoping in the afternoon....so we decided (after clearing up a lot of ticketing mess) to go for a nice ramble, with a picnic lunch.

We started by watching this young 

WHITE WAGTAIL:

Next, we watched a flock of

TITS (Blue or Great? the debate rages between Sumana and me)

foraging:

and sitting on the trees...

A

BLACKBIRD

showed itself in the leaf-litter:

A

FIELDFARE

turned over the leaf-litter in typical Thrush fashion.

I spotted Cupid, out in the spring sunshine:

I realized that I was not the only one watching the birds:

He then stepped out of hiding, that black beauty:

Even "pests" look beautiful sometimes!

I love the way tourists and cyclists are given importance:

I did feel welcome!

We chose a spot near a magnificient pile:

Family photography began happening:

Lunch was not fast enough for some people:

A healthy, yummy dessert!

Having seen Cupid, it was appropriate that I look up into the sky, and saw this sunbow and the arrow of a jet contrail:

</lj-cut>

Quite aptly, too, there were star-crossed clouds!

Advik, whom I have christened Laddu Kumar, was looking particularly sweet.

We came back home, I finished my packing, and Deepak *lugged* my luggage all the way to the bus stop...but that's the next post!
