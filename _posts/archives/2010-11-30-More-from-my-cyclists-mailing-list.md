M wrote about a fall he had, when his helmet cracked, and in the process, saved his head.

A, who is a neurosurgeon, and a cyclist, too, wrote in reply:

"Not everyone's Ganesha, you know. Head transplants still haven't been perfected yet - so good idea to wear a nut saver.On a lighter note, M chose the right moment to fall on his head,just as he passed me, his neurosurgeon biker friend!"

And Y immediately asked, about "nut saver":

"Doc, you referring to a helmet?"


I thoroughly enjoy the mails on this list....
