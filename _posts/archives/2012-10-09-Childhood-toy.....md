When there are power cuts for long periods, when money is an issue, children are happy with traditional toys, too. Here's a video of a boy with a toy:

And here are the children, waving happily to Amith and me as we drive away!

Who knows where these children will be, in the future...right now, they are in the State, not only of Karnataka, but the universal one,  of Innocence...
