A great loneliness sits upon me.
The world seems a vast desert tract
Where exists no human being
That I can call friend,
I am alone...I cannot attract
A single living thing
To myself....I see
Only a thorny path without end.

Don't worry about my writing in this sad strain...
It's only because of my awful migraine!

Today...one friend rang,
And another called on me;
Through my headache, my heart sang
 I had a chat with one, with the other,  some tea.
Several comforted me on Facebook;
As soon as they took a look
At my status update.
They all comforted me...early or late.

This is the millionth time but I'll say it again...
Whether I'm hale or fighting a migraine....
Men or women, boys or girls,
Friends are like shining pearls.
No one can be luckier than me...
I have enough pearls for LOTS of jewellery.

I am so lucky...if just a headache makes me feel this way, how must people with chronic pain feel, how difficult their lives must be! I cannot fault any ill person for being crabby or irritable.

The subject title? Add a "he" to both sides of it!
