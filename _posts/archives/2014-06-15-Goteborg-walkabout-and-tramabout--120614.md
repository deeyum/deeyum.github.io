Sumana gave Advik his food:

And then we went off to see the sights!

The first creature to meet me was this 

HOODED CROW:

Which strutted about as if the world was monochrome:

Buttercups spangled the grass with shiny gold:

<lj-cut text="through the day....">

Advik was, of course, happy to  be out:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410373522" title="IMG_0050 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14410373522_5b834e0631.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0050"></a>

So was his mother!

We took a tram and went past Liseburg Amusement Park:

We saw the Goteborg Museum:

(No point in being indoors on such a glorious day!)

We went to the Asian Store to pick up a few items:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14408313431" title="IMG_0062 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/14408313431_281ef1786a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0062"></a>

I enjoyed watching the trams, having grown up in a city (Kolkata) where trams still run. Some are wheelchair and stroller-friendly, some are not:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410386562" title="IMG_0063 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5571/14410386562_d07931d59e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0063"></a>

I enjoyed looking at the building facades:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410388592" title="IMG_0064 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5196/14410388592_683a6e2b51.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0064"></a>

We went to the mouth of the Gothia River, where the Opera House is:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225080478" title="IMG_0065 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14225080478_2da49a14d3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0065"></a>

A festooned ship was berthed 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225081928" title="IMG_0066 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/14225081928_a00b272cf2.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0066"></a>


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225252987" title="IMG_0069 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5578/14225252987_a232276b61.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0069"></a>

near the "Lipstick" building:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410392842" title="IMG_0067 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/14410392842_87ecdd987c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0067"></a>

There was kayaking too:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225090678" title="IMG_0071 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14225090678_30f9c24053.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0071"></a>

Advik found himself in the hands of the Grand-ma-fia:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225260387" title="IMG_0073 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2901/14225260387_83d71d0f5f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0073"></a>

He didn't seem too unhappy, though:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225106860" title="IMG_0074 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14225106860_f4b9b678c4.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="IMG_0074"></a>

There were Mallards in the water:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14408340241" title="IMG_0077 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5158/14408340241_9e94b7c5a4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0077"></a>

Common Gulls were, well, common:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410562524" title="IMG_0086 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5071/14410562524_16c6c775ff.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0086"></a>

As were Herring Gulls:


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14408361071" title="IMG_0104 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5039/14408361071_bf524a9c86.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="IMG_0104"></a>

and Black-headed Gulls:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225133960" title="IMG_0107 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3925/14225133960_0c8f7b3dbc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0107"></a>

Their tails made such a pretty pattern!
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410432622" title="IMG_0108 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/14410432622_e4f415341e.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="IMG_0108"></a>

they were mewling:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410563694" title="IMG_0088 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3844/14410563694_492b80a958.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="IMG_0088"></a>

they were bathing:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14431907503" title="IMG_0115 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3926/14431907503_29460591e3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0115"></a>

They may be common and pests, but they are still beautiful!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410565104" title="IMG_0090 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5157/14410565104_d0e7a83f52.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="IMG_0090"></a>

More ornate buildings caught my eye:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225274977" title="IMG_0092 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5072/14225274977_fa9755a553.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0092"></a>

With details:

The Germanic word for travel always cracks me up:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225276227" title="IMG_0093 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3897/14225276227_fb80c2847d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0093"></a>

A nearby mall, Nordstan, was festive:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225112738" title="IMG_0095 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5077/14225112738_81c4bddfc5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0095"></a>

Street musicians were "busking":

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14431893263" title="IMG_0097 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14431893263_12a7e6c576.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0097"></a>

Some people's goodness shines out of their eyes:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225285397" title="IMG_0100 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3861/14225285397_0566a512a3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0100"></a>

the town square was lovely:

I saw sea-horses in the air:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225296327" title="IMG_0117 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14225296327_7c7383a150.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0117"></a>

and a man on a horse:

Jackdaws were at the water's edge:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225101189" title="IMG_0123 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3886/14225101189_823817aa1e.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="IMG_0123"></a>

There was love in the air:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14408383671" title="IMG_0133 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3841/14408383671_9a4741fc57.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0133"></a>

Flowers on the ground:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225309947" title="IMG_0135 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14225309947_d9d9e7a811.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0135"></a>

There were children in the air, too!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14431924743" title="IMG_0136 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2934/14431924743_f4c4736f5c.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="IMG_0136"></a>

The sky and clouds looked lovely:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14388631066" title="IMG_0141 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14388631066_e94bc7aaf1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0141"></a>

I watched two opponents, frozen in animosity:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14410611514" title="IMG_0146 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14410611514_7de81e3ea6.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0146"></a>

We passed a beautiful theatre:

Vigettes spotted out of the tram window:

A Hummer as a taxi! The ultimate in consumerism:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14225329607" title="IMG_0158 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2922/14225329607_a16958c2ef.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0158"></a>

Some pretty wildflowers grew by the paths:

This is for Father's Day, which is today:

There are wild strawberries in the Vastare's garden:

</lj-cut>


That was my first experience of Goteborg (pronounced yothebUri) stad (pronounced shtAt):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14408400701" title="IMG_0155 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3896/14408400701_91550f7faf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0155"></a>
