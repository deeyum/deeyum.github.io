Where do my thoughts arise?
How am I able to think, I must write this today?
How do I think thoughts that bring tears to my eyes?
Where do I store the sacred words that let me pray?
Or bring memories that make my happiness glow?
What makes me foolish--or wise?
Where does my body get its commands to make my heart beat, my nails grow?
Where do I begin my smiles,my sighs?
Which part of my body would contain my being?
Where, in this mass of flesh and bone, do *I* live...beyond hearing and seeing?
I will never know.....
