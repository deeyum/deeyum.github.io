What do you do when you come across
A traffic-light of a plant?
To stop, or further to thrive and grow...
What does the plant really want?
I passed this plant, 
My eyes went pop...
The rest of it was green, 
But this leaf made me stop!
Sometimes,one can be just a leaf
Amongst many others, several hundred...
And yet, quietly show how one can
Be different...by being red!

Delmar Blvd, U City, St. Louis, 010713.This was a small plant in a bed of grass on the pavement as I walked along.
