Can you imagine ME not posting for a few days...Miracles do occur! :)

I am usually a passenger on the bad ship INS Omnia, and after a transatlantic trip, the ship becomes a huge ocean liner and really tosses me around. I think I am slowly getting over it now. Of course it doesn't help that when I can't sleep in the watches of the night, there is a daughter who can be talked to/chatted to, halfway across the world....

On other news, I have received a very intersting job offer and am going off tomorrow to try it out. More details later, but I am pondering on several issues....

This will be the first time I will be taking up this kind of a (rather unusual) job. Like all jobs, it obviously comes with both pluses and some minuses. Some of the skills needed for it, I do possess. But others...I will have to learn. And I don't know if I will fall flat on my face...if I make a mistake, it has more ramifications than just egg on my face. So...still pondering. But it is so interesting, and as my daughter said, I will learn several things too. So I am off tomorrow. 

The trial offers wifi access throughout, but like other things in India, that may or may not happen...if it does, of course everyone who reads this will be able to get more details....

Wish me luck everyone. I am thinking of stepping outside the small pond that I inhabit...and I am lucky that I have been given a no-obligation opportunity to test the waters outside. (Though I think, whatever has been said, there IS an obligation.)

Oh well...

Naturally, since I am in a rush to settle all my backlog and leave, my dental filling chose this morning to fall out, so a delightful meeting with the dentist is now scheduled, and I am just going to <strike> drag my reluctant behind to  </strike> the RV Dental College....

Wish me luck with that, too!
