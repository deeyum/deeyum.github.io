I spotted these two people at Jayanagar 4th Block the other day; they are, in fact, mendicants, but add value by dressing up as mythological characters. The characters are usually identifiable, but I could not make out who these two were supposed to represent. I wonder..perhaps it is Rama and Lakshmana?<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24692687@N05/2367875683/" title="dressed as mythological characters jayanagar 4th block 230308 by idesmarch08, on Flickr"><img width="480" height="360" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2367875683_d72a1eb07c_o.jpg" alt="dressed as mythological characters jayanagar 4th block 230308" /></a><br /></div><br /><br />But if so, the bows and arrows are missing.<br /><br />They were taking a little break from work; I saw them a little earlier, asking for alms....
