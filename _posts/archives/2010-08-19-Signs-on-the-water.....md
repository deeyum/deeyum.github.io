As usual, some signs struck my eye in Kerala, too, and I snapped quick shots as I passed....

You might have heard of ships which are called Minesweepers, which are instrumental in finding mines in the sea....but I loved the idea of having a Mindsweeper:

Would this ship locate all negative ideas in the minds of those passing by?

Also, if you want a "waterline" rather than an airline, you could use this one:

remember, though, that "they" of Cathey might charge you well!

But if you want to have no troubles at all, while on your travels, then call this number:
