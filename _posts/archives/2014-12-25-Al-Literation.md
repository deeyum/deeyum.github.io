A friend said, "More than a decade ago, you'd produced a list of 'Arab' words, beginning with 'al'....let's have the list again!"

I can't remember too many, but here are the ones that I do:

Lazy Arab: Album
Arab who prefers men: Algae
Arab who likes stripes: Algebra (the interesting part about this word is that, truly, the world algebra is derived from the word for zero...al-sifr..you can "hear" the "siro" becoming ziro, to zero, to zebr to gebr to gebra!)
Arab who likes the US (is there such a one?) Alabama (or even Alobama :D )
Arab losing hair: Alopaecia
Arab unity: Altogether
Arab twins: Alike
Arab tragedy: Alas
Arab world: Alok
Arab memory loss: Alzheimer
Nearing the end of this list: Almost Done!

 I'm amazed that my friend remembers this list... I'd tot(al)ly forgotten it!
