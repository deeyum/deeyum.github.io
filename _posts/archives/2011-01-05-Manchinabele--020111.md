After a very long time, we had a local BULBs (Bangalore Urban LadyBirders) outing (it was beginning to seem as if they went only on international trips!), and we decided to go to Manchinabele Reservoir.

As usual, the day started with fog and mist:

<lj-cut text="some more images">


Here the BULBs are:

I got this

ASHY-CROWNED SPARROW LARK

upon the wire...I usually see it on the ground:

The

RED-RUMPED SWALLOW

 was showing that red rump!

One of our most common birds, the 

BLACK KITE

still looks handsome!

We enjoyed watching a group of 

SILVERBILLS

..especially when two seemed to be kissing!

a juvenile

BRAHMINY KITE

soared overhead:

An

INDIAN ROBIN

posed for us on a granite pole:

After a long time, I decided to shoot a

SMALL GREEN BEE-EATER

...another common but very beautiful bird!

As we left, we found this 

SHIKRA

in the tree, and it probably had its nest there, too.

Here are the peaceful-looking waters of the Reservoir:

We also saw a lot of people meeting and discussing next week's cycling outing; many kayaks were on the water after the discussion!

I did get a couple of butterflies; here's a

ZEBRA BLUE:

Here's a 

LYCENID, 

Rohit says it's a 

PEA BLUE:

Here are my shots of the majestic
