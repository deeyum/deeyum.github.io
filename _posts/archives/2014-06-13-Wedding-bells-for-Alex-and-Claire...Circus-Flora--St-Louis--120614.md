​Lynx, Duck, Tonty...I'd first met Alex Wallenda on a flight out of St.Louis:

And last year, when I voluteered at Circus Flora with Ruth (who has introduced me to so many volunteering opportunities in St.Louis!), I met Claire and Alex:

almost exactly 2 years ago! (15th of June!)

Alex, Claire...it's lovely to see you getting together in the holy bonds of matrimony....I will be in St.Louis from August; I do not know if you two will be in St.Louis there, or practising elsewhere...but wherever you are, our good wishes go with you, for many more happy years of togetherness!

My family, including my grandchildren, came and watched the circus a few days ago...so I thought they, too, would be interested in the wedding bells ringing out!

Lots of love, Deepa.
