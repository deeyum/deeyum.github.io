I read about the

<a href="http://fox2now.com/2013/08/17/paper-cranes-on-art-hill-honor-fallen-first-responders/"> STL Crane Project </a>

I decided to to  do a different kind of bird-watching, and visit Art Hill on my way to Kennedy Forest. I saw the installation from a distance...

As I came closer, the installation was clearer.

Other visitors were also photographing the origami cranes:

The only thing I disliked was that each crane was weighted down with two ziploc bags of sand...a huge wastage of plastic:

Cheerful volunteers were collecting $10 for each bird (which could be take away after the weekend):

I went with DS and KTB to Kaufmann Park, later, and found a crane in front of one of the houses, too :)
