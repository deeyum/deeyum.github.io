This was supposed to be a walk to the Norman Probstein Golf Course, to see the gourds and boxes of the

PURPLE MARTINS

about which I'd posted earlier,

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/537003.html"> here </a>

However, the "official" walk was cancelled, due to possible inclement weather. Here's the path as I walked up to the Visitors' Center:

 Several of us

enjoyed John Miller's

 informative talk about them...and since the weather had cleared up considerably when we emerged from the Visitors' Center, several of us decided to follow Mark Glenshaw over to see the Great Horned Owls.

 Mark and Brenda are nothing short of superb in their skills at spotting these birds in the heavy vegetation and the rainy, low-light conditions...so we were able to enjoy the sight of these majestic birds.

We saw this

RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD

 male, showing why he is named so:

We then walked further, looking at various waterfowl, such as this 

MALLARD couple, the

GREEN HERON:

and this 

SNOWY EGRET, fishing:

and then Liz, John, and Robert agreed to come with me to see the Purple Martins at the Norman Probstein Golf Course. On the way, we saw several birds, including this 

EASTERN KINGBIRD

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/8942437314/" title="DSC09256 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5457/8942437314_a5597514c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="616" alt="DSC09256"></a>

 We finally saw the Purple Martins, too, in their gourds and boxes,


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/8941816077/" title="DSC09274 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/8941816077_827cdf9beb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="DSC09274"></a>

 swooping and hawking for insects.

We then went to the Prairie area, saw some more birds such as this

RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD female and the EASTERN KINGBIRD,

the 

SONG SPARROW:

We went home after a very enjoyable morning.




Here are Robert, John and Liz, who were patient enough to be with me on my peregrinations!

The common birds of Forest Park continue to fascinate and delight me! I've put up some of my SMS (Shamelessly Mediocre Shots) on a web album,

I've also written the narrative.

Liz was kind enough to give me a ride back home...it was 1pm by then! Another lovely Saturday morning, spent in my favourite haunt!
