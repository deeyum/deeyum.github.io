I agree with most of that...I started blogging for my homesick child, very far away...and it was a welcome surprise to realize that I had more than one reader! 

Here's a pic of the grasses all lit up by the sunshine, against the granite that is so characteristic of this part of Karnataka....

Oh, no reason to post those photographs, I "simbly" did it...!
