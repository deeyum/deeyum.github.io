Here are DnA, along with my little GD (She Who Is Yet To Be Named):

That's DnA, with their DNA passed on to the next generation....and it's really Eli's "birth" day. (All the others will be birth anniversaries, actually.)

I am petrified of writing something that will not meet with A's wishes! :)

The hospital is very accomodative of families; both KM and I have spent the entire day here and will return home only after dinner; we will have a good night's sleep, and get back to the hospital tomorrow after the day's chores are finished.
