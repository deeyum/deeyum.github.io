OK,OK, so LJ is a great way to express myself without fear of the editor's pencil, but one DOES like to see one's name in print, too, so the regular exercise of sending articles here and there and hoping for a "yes"...and sadly counting the "no"s....

In the midst of trying to find a home for my article about the costs involved in wildlife photography...poor little orphan baby, when will you find a home?

The process reminded me of the words of Wodehouse (one of my favourite authors)

If an editor accepts an article, send another article to that editor. If an editor rejects an article, send that article to another editor!
