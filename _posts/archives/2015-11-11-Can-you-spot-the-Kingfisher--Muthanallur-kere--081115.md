On the 8th of November, Ajit, Kumar, Kumuda and I went to Muthanallur lake (beyond Kaikondrahalli lake). They'd visited earlier this year and the lake was bone-dry,and filled with trash. Well, trash was still around, but the lake had plenty of water...and plenty oflife!

Can you spot the Small Blue Kingfisher in this picture?

I assure you, it's there. I got this at half-zoom on my camera, from the very same spot:

Then I zoomed in a little more, to get this feathered jewel:

I love the superzoom on my camera that lets me capture things without going near them, or disturbing them! What wonderful technology!
