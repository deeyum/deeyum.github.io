I went to the Farmers' Market with my friends Divya and Chinmay, who've just arrived in St.Louis, with their son, Siddhartha. I love mushrooms, and I saw a nice lot of it there. But AM had told me they are not everyone else's favourite, so...since I love my daughter, I came home without buying them

The next day, she came home from grocery shopping, and lo and behold, a box of mushrooms were in her hand..."These are for you, Amma, because you love them!" she said. I love mushrooms dearly, but I love my daughter even more....

So here are the mushrooms, getting sliced for the khumbh-matar that I made...

Here's the matar part of the khumbh-matar:

Onion, tomato and ginger ground together and sauteed made the base for the dish.

The mushrooms and the peas were simmered together in this base, and it was a delicious dish...which passed into history almost immediately...the surprise fan being 2-year-old Siddhartha, who polished the last of it off while we were walking back from visiting the Zoo!
