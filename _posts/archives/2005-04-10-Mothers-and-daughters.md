Went to a concert by Pandit Jasraj at someone's house....sat next to two mothers who were with their daughters...they hugged them, talked to them, put their heads on their laps....I mused about the special relationship between mothers and daughters. In our culture, mothers and sons are not encouraged to show physical affection for each other. How sad, that a teenage son cannot sit unselfconsciously with his mother in a gathering like this...our boys are never taught to express physical affection at all....they grow up repressed. But it was still lovely to see the two mothers and daughters...here's a thought for all of them out there! Missing mine and so I called her up....
