I don't like mass-mailing my friends with New Year or other festive wishes (see <LJ user="amoghavarsha">'s post, 

http://amoghavarsha.livejournal.com/73411.html

 for much the same opinion)

...but I can now see ONE reason why people would do it.

I find myself thinking, every now and then....did I wish X? Y? Z? and what about all those other alphabets I am friendly with? 

I am hoping that all my friends will realize that I am like this vunly, and will wish back when someone wishes me...but will not send new year greetings to some thousands of people.

All of you out there...Happy Birthday, whenever that is!!
