Pune seems such a nice city, especially the suburbs. It has escaped, so far, at least, the madcap development of Bangalore, and remains very green. Night temperatures are very pleasant even if the days are hot. There are picturesque places to walk in early in the morning. Even flats are built with lots of open spaces and plenty of greeenery...gives a pleasant, open feeling. 

oh, well...back to the hung flyover, dusty roads on which trees were felled two years ago, and an idle, corrupt non-governance....we drive down the beautiful Pune- Mumbai highway this morning, and fly back to good old Bangalore.
