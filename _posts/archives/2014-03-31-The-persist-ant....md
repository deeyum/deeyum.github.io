Scurrying across the path
I saw this little ant.
It bore a heavy burden,
Its legs were all aslant.

It stopped every now and then
And shifted the mouthful it had.
But never gave up on the task:
A persistent lady...or lad.

The prey in its jaws 
Was about its own size.
But the long-legged ant
Seemed found it tasty and nice.

I never did find out
How the story ended.
Did the ant succeed,
As its way it wended?

Did the other ants in the nest
Cheer at a successful chore?
Or did the ant abandon
Its task, and drag it no more?

I left it a mystery
As I consigned the moment to history.
