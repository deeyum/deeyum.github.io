On my way to the bus terminus in Pune, I saw parts of this historic city that I've never seen before...

Here's the deity that I snapped as I went past:

I also passed the Fort:

I'll have to go back to Pune to explore these wonderful areas. How come I've visited Pune so many times and never been here at all? The place was alive with people, shops and bustle...the heart of India, beating strongly in its populous cities.
