For several years now, I have been a proponent of what I call the WBC..(Walk,Bus,Cycle)...so it was very nice to see the St Louis Metro also having a similar initiative:

I do like the name a lot! Though it started just before we reached St Louis, I saw it only when I went to the Public Library yesterday, and I am registering for it, since I do exactly what the initiative is asking...use my feet and the Metro!
