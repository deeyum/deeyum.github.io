I am sure that outward looks don't matter, what matters is the person within...but why, then, when I see/meet a good-looking person, do I want to talk to them more than to a non-good-looking person? The impulse subsides within a few minutes of exchanging a few words with the GLP, if even the voice doesn't match..but why can't I school myself out of this response?
