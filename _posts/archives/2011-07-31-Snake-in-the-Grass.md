<lj user="idahoswede">, do NOT see this entry. Please go to the next friend's post

This morning, a group of us went to Valley School, and we saw a baby 

<a href=""> COBRA </a>

 slithering across the path:

<lj-cut text="more about the snake">


All of us who had cameras whipped them out to document it:

A baby cobra is apparently no less deadly than an adult one, but this one had no menace at all; it was simply scurrying for cover.

It was quite stressed, and put up its hood a little bit:

The hood came up even more as it slithered past:
