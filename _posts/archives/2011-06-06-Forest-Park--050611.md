This morning, I decided to go and meet

<a href="http://www.dannybrownphotography.com/"> Danny Brown </a>

and share in his quest for the minks. Alas, the minks practically came underfoot, about half an hour before I got there! But nevertheless, I had a lovely time. 

I met Danny, who was looking out over the creek, and watching the creatures he captures so well:

We watched a mother 

WOOD DUCK

 and her brood swim up the creek:

And then climb up the waterfall, salmon-like!

Then the male Wood Duck came along, replesendent in his colours:

Having got him from one side, I had to get the other:

And got him swimming:

We saw a couple of 

GREEN HERONS

fishing in their habitat:

I was able to get one closer up:

I got more photographs, and they are uploaded at Facebook,

Came back home full of peace and happiness....thank you, Danny!
