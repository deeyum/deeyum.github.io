I realized that I haven't been to Lalbagh at all...so this was my first visit in about 9 months! I went to see the Republic Day Flower Show display, but that was more or less as usual...but what I loved was the sight of my favourite giant silk-cotton tree, with these three Rose-Ringed Parakeets having breakfast with a dove:

Sometimes it was 3 of each, parakeet and squirrel:

The Tent Spider Webs were ready to catch breakfast for their spinners...

And the trees and the morning sunlight, shafting through their branches, reminded me why I love this public park so much....

I'm bidding adieu to my home town for a few months....but Bangalore, I love you...
