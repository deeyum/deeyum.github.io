<P>...


I was reading the Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book....and I realized that &nbsp;my little Hobbes userpic is actually the very&nbsp;first &nbsp;transmogrification of &nbsp;Calvin! Cool! 

If any of you haven't got that...that book is the one where Watterson himself has selected the cartoons, and talked about his work, the characters and so on. It also contains the first Calvin strip. Great collector's item!</P>
