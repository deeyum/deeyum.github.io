Last Sunday,Krupakar, and his wife Pooh (Poonam), Vittal  and I all went for a short, gentle trip to Bannerghatta Zoo Area.

We saw this 

COMMON GULL

and that is the "known";

what is unknown is...

what are these

COTTON STAINER BUGS

doing? "Mating" would be an easy answer, but it doesn't seem as simple as that....

(Sorry, the pic is out of focus!)

Insect yoga?

And then I saw, on a small leaf, this conglomeration of caterpillars:

I do not know what cats they are, why they've all huddled together like that...can anyone throw some light on this please?

It reminded me of

by Anush; he was given the info that it helps the caterpillars to survive.
