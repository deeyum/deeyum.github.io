Though her birthday is on the 29th, the party happened on Sunday, the 26th.

Here are some of us:

I rather like this pic of LS that I took at a friend's home after the party:

It was a nice day...I cannot imagine that my grand-daughter is entering her seventh year of life! DnA took a lot of trouble to have a great party.
