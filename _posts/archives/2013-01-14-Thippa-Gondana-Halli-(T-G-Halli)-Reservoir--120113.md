and I decided to visit 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thippagondanahalli_Reservoir"> T G Halli Reservoir </a>

it was good that we made an early start, because though we got to the area quickly, it took us quite a while to figure out access paths to the water body. 

I'd previously visited over 5 years ago, and the drying up of the lake was a shock. However, there was enough water for the birds, and wonderful views...so we accessed the reservoir at two different places, and had a wonderful time.

This floating feather, with water drops on it, seemed to symbolize the presence of both water and birds, for me.

I started off with this 

BLISTER BEETLE

with dewdrops on its back, sitting on an Ipomaeia flower:

We found many species of birds, like this 

COMMON SANDPIPER:

JERDON'S BUSHLARK:

The old, once-submerged temple was fully in view, and a skein of Cormorants flew past in a devout line:

On the way back, I was tickled by a temple arch in which Shiva had built Himself a honeycomb screen:

Amongst all the litter on the lake was this warning...

Well, plastic trash kills as well!

I was tickled pink by this house in glorious technicolour:
