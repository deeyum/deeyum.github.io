I so thoroughly enjoyed myself on our trip to Bannerghatta Zoo area today....we were FIFTEEN of us! (Names follow, where they belong..in the mammals' list!)

We finally decided on the Zoo area as we got extremely delayed, and some of us were also constrained to get back early...some of us were actually going in to work! It was the easiest destination to get to, and Fauzia, for example could quickly take a bus from the terminus and get back to work. 

I must say, the Zoo area never disappoints me....here we are, setting out after parking our cars....on the left is the JLR Hill View Restaurant, and on the right, with the buildings showing behind us, is the new bus terminus....

And...here are our shadows on the rock!

<lj-cut text="some pics from the outing"> 

Since we were not allowed to go on the road behind the Butterfly Park, we just walked through the eucalyptus groves and lantana that surround the JLR Hill View Restaurant, and we started out with several

ORIENTAL WHITE-EYES...

can you see one in this pic?

If not, NOW, can you see it?

It was lovely to watch a whole flock of them for a while, along with lots of Sunbirds...here's a

PURPLE-RUMPED SUNBIRD

in eclipse plumage:

We sighted an 

ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD 

(pic on Facebook album) and another un id raptor that looked like a Falcon (id to be confirmed)  and the migrants we sighted were the

BROWN SHRIKE:

the Barn Swallows, the Asian Paradise Flycatcher, and the Grey Wagtails.

I loved the sight of this beautiful

BLACK-HEADED CUCKOO-SHRIKE:

a

SMALL MINIVET

couple delighted us with their appearance:

Later, at the lake, I got two lovely 

SMALL BLUE KINGFISHERS...

one looking left,

and one looking right:

Here's a lousy video...I was shooting right against the harsh sun...of two 

PIED KINGFISHERS

hovering over the Crocodile Pond:


<lj-embed id="611"/>

and then, Pratima spotted the actual

CROCODILE

itself...here it is, its name is Basker.. its grin seems more fearsome than its tears!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0184.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0184.jpg" border="0" alt="croc 140111 bgz"></a>

then, next to it, Vittal spotted  a

MONGOOSE:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0188.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0188.jpg" border="0" alt="mngoose 140111"></a>

and here are both of them, together!



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0194.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0194.jpg" border="0" alt="croc and mngs 140111"></a>

We also ..er...spotted a CHITAL (pic on FB).

Smaller creatures included this 

PUPA 

of a 

PREYING MANTIS:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0150.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0150.jpg" border="0" alt="pryng mnts ppa 140111"></a>

but "remains" seemed to be the order of the day, as we saw the discarded moult of a

COMB-FOOTED SPIDER:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0138.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0138.jpg" border="0" alt="moult of cf spider 140111"></a>

and the shell of a 

SNAIL

that had been killed when a fire was lit in the area:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0147.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0147.jpg" border="0" alt="roasted snl 140111"></a>

Another sad thing was this dead

COMMON MORMON

...this one was the uncommon Cyrus morph (thanks, Rohit!)
