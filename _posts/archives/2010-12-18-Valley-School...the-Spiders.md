 the Spiderman!


For various reasons, after attending the Training Session, I had to drop out of the Elephant Trail Survey, and I was a little disappointed about it, until I fixed up with Anand Bhat to go to Valley School this morning. Instant restoration of good spirits :)


Here are some of the beautiful spiders that we saw:


This one I cannot id, but it was a really tiny one (that's my finger skin that it's sitting on!)

Karthik says this one is a 

DEBRIS ORB SPIDER:

Some of the spiders are, of course, software engineers. Here's one developing a beautiful website:

The idea is to make a wonderful creation, like this:

Of course, there were a lot of

GIANT WOOD SPIDERS

around:

More about the other creatures and birds that we saw, after I get back from the Citizen Matters pEtE mAtu today!
