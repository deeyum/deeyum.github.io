The Reindeer's grandfather was visiting Cochin, so her mother asked for an ethnic umbrella (The Reindeer specified purple.) 

The Thatha conveyed the request as one for an ordinary purple umbrella, on his return to Bangalore, to the Paati Animal. She got The Reindeer  an exquisite Made in China (but *purple*) umbrella. Reindeer was apparently delighted.

Her mother's 1989 Disney World name-painted-on umbrella was also sent. I bet they will not have any handy on the next rainy day....
