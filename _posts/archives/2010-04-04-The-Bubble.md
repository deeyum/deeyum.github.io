We forget that life's a bubble.....

And it's brought home to us every now and then, in sharp reminders, too sharp to bear sometimes.

But then, to those who say, "Live each day as if it was your last," I reply, No, we cannot do that. We *have* to think that we have a future, and plan for it. Life would be impossible to live if I were to think of death constantly, or think that this was my last day on earth. But yes...I need to remember the beautiful, evanescent bubble now and then....what lies beyond it, I do not know, so I will enjoy life to the fullest, while not letting thoughts of death overpower me.
