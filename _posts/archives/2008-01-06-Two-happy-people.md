As we left Ranganathittu on our way home...

She doesn't have an i-Pod, she doesn't own a Merc;
Her life, for the most part, is extremely hard work.
Two goats, two palm trees, toil all the while...
But how can someone be called poor with  that simple, happy smile?


And here's a photo taken by <LJ user="amoghavarsha">

She doesn't have an i-Pod, she doesn't own a Merc;
She has never faced the other woman's kind of heavy work.
But she is aware of her good fortune, the freedom from strife,
She is happy that she can lead such a lovely life.
