Some of us had been to Ramnagara last year, but after that, senior birders were concerned about the disturbance to the LONG-BILLED VULTURES, so birders have stopped going there now. But I think, after seeing <LJ user="amoghavarsha">'s post today, enough time has elapsed that I can post my  bird photographs on my own blog at least.....

Here's my usual sunrise photo:

Ramnagara is a beautiful place, and I have posted about the beauty of the Ramagiri temple there at

Let me show you this lovely scene...I call that centre rock the "Eternal Triangle"!

There is an old ruined structure on the lower part of the sheet rock; it might have been a temple at one time, I don't know, but it looks picturesque:

A really beautiful, scenic spot!

Here's the Egyptian Vulture, soaring overhead:

It's a beautiful bird, which I have sighted at Nandi Hills, too.

And here is the Long-Billed Vulture, taking off from the rock face:

And here the magnificient bird is in flight:

I find that these birds are not uncommon in north India (I saw many of them in Kanha) but the idea of the informal ban was that one should not disturb their nesting site here, as their numbers here are very, very low.
