Here's a picture of one of our relatives (well, technically KM's...but you know how it is, after 30 years of marriage, there are no YOUR relatives and MY relatives, only OURS)...a very hard-working lady who has stood by her husband's business ups and downs, always lending a helping hand as well as coping with the household, with staunch affection.

She is always so happy to see us and is SO hospitable, I invariably exit her home quite stuffed to the gills!

She is wearing the traditional silk saree, woven in the town of Kanchipuram, or Kanjeevaram, that all of us women in the South like to wear at festive occasions...

Photo taken by that good photographer, <LJ user="amoghavarsha">, who was forgiven for coming VERY late to this festivity, because he took such great snaps of the people who were still around!
