Here's a water tank on top of a building in Chennapatna (I think) on the road from Bangalore to Mysore....

I sent it along to a few of my American friends, including someone who is known for his quick repartee...his response was, "Water they thinking?"

The Maruti 800 is our version of the British Mini..a ubiquitous little runabout, great to get from A to B.
