Sometimes, life brings on a whole lot of complications all at once. One minute, you're coasting along in relative ease, and peace...and within a few minutes, you get some news that has you worried, concerned how to cope with it...and sometimes the various ...difficulties, for want of a better word...seem to be a knotted ball of twine, where you don't know which thread to start unpicking first...you only know that this unpicking is going to be a long-drawn-out process, and it might not unpick the knotted ball at all...

Suddenly, all clarity of vision seems to desert you as first one problem, and then the other, struggles to the forefront of your mind. As you try and sort one out, you feel that the others need attention first...it causes a welter of confused thoughts in your head, and you start feeling like that hamster on the wheel.

You look back to the calm of the previous day, or the previous hour, and wonder why  you thought you had worries then! And you look at the other people around you, feeling envious that they don't seem to be affected like this...but the fact is that they may not be affected like this right now, but that they, too, would have undergone similar periods. 

You just have to remind yourself that you *have* passed through other similar worrying periods, and they do ease off...even though it doesn't look likely at the moment!...then back you go to worrying, worrying....your mind touching on each worry like a tongue to a sore spot in the mouth that stings, yet the tongue must explore it now and then....

How true it is that "the mind is a monkey" and control over it is truly the greatest, hardest conquest of all.

This is just me musing...right now, I am in a peaceful phase!
