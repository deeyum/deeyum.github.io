We looked into a kind of moat around the Gorukana resort reception, and on the  petals of the lotus flowers that the staff had floated in it,  was a lot of life:

The grasshopper had company...this little frog:

and this Dung Beetle:

(what was a Dung Beetle doing on a lotus flower? I don't know!)

But right next to these living creatures, was a dead one. Sometimes, death is beautiful too...

For some reason, the colour of the grasshopper was quite surreal.
