That's the past tense  of "simplicity"....

Yes. Simplicity is a word with only a past tense...I can't believe that for YEARS I did not have a mobile phone, and did perfectly well without it!

After much rooting around in "my" mobile shop (around the corner!) we found that the  Nokia E 63 has fallen in price from X to less than half X, so my nimble-fingered OPS (Old Phone Stealer) has, instead of making me  incur an expenditure of Y (it would have been a small "y", too!)... has made it 8Y...because now I will have to change my mobile service provider plan to include internet.

The good thing is, the E63 has Nokia maps, as well as email and  green tonsils and blue tooth and all those et ceteras..and has a qwerty keyboard instead of the detested-by-me "full touch" where I have no idea what key I am typing.

It will no longer fit into my jeans pocket the way the Old Inexpensive phone used to do....and it served me beautifully for so many years too. Bye-bye, old phone...*wipes away a tear for the simple old days".

I expect to look back at this post when I am ninety, when I will blog that I now have to get the latest brain-implant chip, and wipe away a tear for the good old days....
