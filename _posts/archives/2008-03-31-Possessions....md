Yesterday a friend of mine moved back into Bangalore, and we went over to help....and I couldn't help wondering why we seem to surround ourselves with so many more possessions than we could possibly need.... why do we tend to accumulate so much of stuff? Everything looks so attractive, so potentially useful, and sometimes so ..just must-have...when we see them, and they come to join us in our daily existence. And then, of course, there are the things that are given to us by those around us; they are tokens of affection, so we accept those too, and give them place in our homes....but the sad truth is that so much of our possessions are only clutter, and we don't have the inclination, the ability, or the clarity to identify them as such, and get rid of them. We are like magpies, picking up whatever we see and bringing it back to the nest, and we wind up with homes that overflow with what we like to think are possessions, but are often...just junk!
