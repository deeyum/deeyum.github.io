WAQT NAHI

Har khushi Hai Logon Ke Daman Mein,
Par Ek Hansi Ke Liye Waqt Nahi.
Din Raat Daudti Duniya Mein ,
Zindagi Ke Liye Hi Waqt Nahi.

Maa Ki Loree Ka Ehsaas To Hai,
Par Maa Ko Maa Kehne Ka Waqt Nahi.
Saare Rishton Ko To Hum Maar Chuke,
Ab Unhe Dafnane Ka Bhi Waqt Nahi.

Saare Naam Mobile Mein Hain ,
Par Dosti Ke Lye Waqt Nahi.
Gairon Ki Kya Baat Karen,
Jab Apno Ke Liye Hi Waqt Nahi.

Aankhon Me Hai Neend Badee ,
Par Sone Ka Waqt Nahi.
Dil Hai Ghamon Se Bhara Hua,
Par Rone Ka Bhi Waqt Nahi.

Paison ki Daud Me Aise Daude,
Ki Thakne ka Bhi Waqt Nahi.
Paraye Ehsason Ki Kya Kadr Karein,
Jab Apane Sapno Ke Liye Hi Waqt Nahi.

Tu Hi Bata E Zindagi,
Iss Zindagi Ka Kya Hoga,
Ki  Har Pal Marne Walon Ko,
Jeene Ke Liye Bhi Waqt Nahi.......! 




People have every joy in their hearts,
But there is no time for even a single laugh.
In the day-and-night running of the world,
There is no time for life.

The mother's lullaby is experienced,
But there is no time to call her "Mother".
We have killed all relationships,
But there is no time to bury them.

All the names are in the mobile (phone),
But there is no time for friendship.
Why speak of others,
When there is no time for one's own.

The eyes are drooping with drowsiness,
But there is no time to sleep.
The heart is filled with woes,
But there is no time to cry.

We run so fast in the race for money,
That there is no time to even tire.
Why speak of other's feelings,
When there is no time for one's own dreams.

Oh! Life...you tell me,
What will happen to this life,
If people find, while undergoing death every minute
There is no time to live...!

Thank you, O P Goel!
