....

Lalbagh also has its rules...has anyone seen them? If so, how many people observe them? I see plenty of plastic bags, I see fishing poles, bidis and cigarettes, stray dogs,....all the time! I wouldn't like to comment about the rest of the list....surely carving "Krishna loves Alka" on the trees comes under the purvey of the last rule?....
