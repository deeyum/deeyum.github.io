Here's an article I really enjoyed reading in the Sunday Herald, which is the Sunday supplement of the Deccan Herald:

http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/May182008/sundayherald2008051768487.asp

All these people post their photographs regularly on <a href="www.indianaturewatch.net"> INW </a>

But Shiva, especially, has been very, very helpful to me about photography and post-processing (though I have decided not to do much of post-processing on my photos.)...and this was  well before he  met me personally. 


However, Shiva had this comment to make:

"The press guys have messed up a lot with the content....
something and all they have written -- compared to what we told them....'Bar headed geese @ TGHalli'... what  the neck band ?!?!? It  was supposed to be Somanathpura!"

Accurate reporting or not....great going, guys! :)
