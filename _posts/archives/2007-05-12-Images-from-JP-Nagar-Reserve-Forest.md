Today's birding was not of the best; managed to get a shot of this Purple-Rumped Sunbird with a little insect in its mouth:

There were these two un-id'd fruits..No, an anonymous reader informs me that this is the "Karvanda" fruit:

The same reader, and Madhusmita Dutta who took the JLRNTP earlier than I did, tell me that this one is a dried Sitaphal (custard apple) (though it did appear very much smaller than a custard apple to ME):

and this frond, waving in the breeze, waiting to disperse its seeds:

But most of all, I loved this peaceful scene:

Such a scene of togetherness and communion with Nature...I was just wishing that KM and I are like this....and just then, the lady pulled out a mobile, and yakked steadily into it for the rest of the time that I could see them!
