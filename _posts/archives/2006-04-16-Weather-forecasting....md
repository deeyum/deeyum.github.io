What is being user-friendly?

We have our weather report on the radio or TV or newspaper, which gives the max and min temps, and the humidity and the rainfall.

Now look at the headings under which the weather is given for a city in the US:


Saint Louis, Missouri, United States Specialty Forecasts:
Aches & Pains | Air Quality | City Guide | Cold & Flu | Events | Fitness | Home | Lawn & Garden | Miracle-Gro Garden Advice | Rush Hour - Live Traffic | Mosquito Activity | Picnic / Grilling | PetCast | PollenCast | Scenic Drives | Schoolday | Scotts Weekly Lawn Update | Skin Protection | Sports Events | Your Holiday Helper     

THAT's being user-friendly.
