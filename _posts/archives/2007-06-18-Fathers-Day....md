<LJ user="premkudva"> scanned and posted the beautiful Father's Day card that his daughter had made...it reminded me of the time when our daughter made a lovely, colourful card, which read:

"Dear Appa,

You are not witty or wise,
But indeed, very nice."

That's what I call honest affection! I laughed, and KM frowned....I think I still have that card somewhere!
