Apparently, as a result of  cataract surgery, for people who've had
short sight (myopia) retinal degeneration (this vairety  is called a
lattice tear, see

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_degeneration

it needs laser surgery without delay)

gets accelerated in a few people..

I was seeing flashes and floaters  for the past 2 days, and went to
get it checked out. I had not expected that I would have to
immediately  undergo some laser surgery to "stitch" the weak area,
which had the tear. Contrary to the mild discomfort of the cataract
surgery, this was rrather painful and the  surgeon (Ms. Chitralekha, a
retinal laser specialist)  had to do it with pauses ( I did not choose
the alternative of getting it done under general anasthesia>). So
right now, rather deep eye pain in my left eye and both eyes dilated.

I've taken a painkiller. I'm glad I went to get it checked out
immijetly. I've been asked  to use my eyes normally but avoid "active
sports"...so Magic Johnson won't be hearing from me in the next couple
of days.

So...even two weeks after surgery...one should not ignore any sympotms.
