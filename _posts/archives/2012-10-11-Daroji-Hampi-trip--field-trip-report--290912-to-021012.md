Several of us drove down to Daroji and Hampi, leaving on the 29th of
September and returning on the 2nd of October, 2013. The group from
Bangalore conisted of: Manjula Sridhar, Rama Warrier,  Rohan
Chakravarty, Santosh Bengaluru, Samrat, Tharangini Bala, and myself.
We were very lucky to meet up with Dr Arun S K, Dr Nagraj C S,
Pompayyaswamy Malemath, Samad Kottur, and Santosh Martin, all  from
Bellary. They made it a very memorable visit for us.

We attended the inaugural function of World Wildlife Week organized by
the Daroji Karadi Dhama, where the children of two schools took part.
We were able to gaze, quite awestruck, at the wonderful book,
"Darojji- An Ecological Destination" (authored by  Vijay Mohan Raj,
Ganesh HS and Samad Kottur)  that was about to be launched.

Naturalists from Bellary are even warmer than the weather there! And
this time, some monsoon clouds (and the occasional shower) helped us
be out of doors practically the entire day, during our visit. Mr
Pompayyah's incredible spotting skills, Santosh's helpfulness, Samad's
speech to the children, that had the convincing quality of coming from
the heart, Dr Arun's great sense of humour...everything contributed to
a great visit, to both the wildlife and the heritage sites. The food
was excellent, and Manjula asked for some local cuisine like Shusla,
Jhunka, Obbattu,  and Shenga Pudi, thanks to which I am certainly
fatter now.

A heartfelt thank you to all of them.

Here's the list of creatures. Alas, I am not able to maintain an
"as-seen" list as I can only tabulate the list when I get back in the
evening, and have to do it with my eyes drooping with sleep! If I have
left out anything, the fault is mine, and I request my friends to
supply th missing names. Also, where my IQ (Ignorance Quotient) is
high, I've just mentioned generic names. The list includes everything
seen and observed on our drive to and from Daroji, as well.

I've put up photos on my FaceBook album for public viewing, for each
day of the visit, and have uploaded a few videos, too, the links to
which are in the photo albums.

Cheers, Deepa.
