I followed one man as he went to vote on Super Tuesday.

<lj-cut text="you want to follow, too?">

The voting venue was in a church just a few blocks away from this man's home, and he walked through the rainy afternoon until he saw the sign:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2245449584/" title="slay is the mayor of st Louis by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2149/2245449584_f6bfce3c43_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="slay is the mayor of st Louis" /></a>

Slay is the mayor of St Louis, and I personally thought he had been doing a good job, but obviously, others think otherwise.

I missed the sign that said, "No Electioneering Allowed." This also included   any exit polls. So at this venue, voters were not disturbed at all.

The man turned into the church area:

In the basement was the list of Presidential candidates:

There's also a city propositon, that, presumably, must be voted for.


I saw the guy in the plaid shirt explaining the procedure to a couple who were not entirely sure what to do.

Here's one of the voting booths:

The man stood in the queue (on the left-hand side) and got his ballot paper:

He then sat down at a booth to for a last-minute deliberation:

And then, as another man sat at the booth opposite him, he cast his vote:

He then went to drop the ballot in the box:

After voting, the man came out of the dark church basement, wearing this sticker:

An important thing for us Indians to note...I was at no point of time asked not to come in because I was not a citizen, or prevented from taking photographs. I am SURE that in India this would not be the case. There would have been SOME "Do Not"s forced upon a non-citizen, especially one with a camera. 


Adult franchise in a democracy....one of the most wonderful things that a free human being can think of.
