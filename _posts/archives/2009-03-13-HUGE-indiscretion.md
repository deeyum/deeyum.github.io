I thought I was posting some information about one person to another, both of whom are undergoing a lot of difficulties... and posted it to a whole egroup....I am feeling utterly miserable. This is the kind of damage that I cannot undo; and to talk more about it would only make it worse. 

The worst part is that the person concerned is extremely sweet-natured, and has quietly overlooked such a bad gaffe on my part....and will probably forgive me whole-heartedly, too..that makes me, actually, feel worse.

I wish I was more careful....but as a friend said, I cannot repine too much over it, but must be very, very careful in future..I *am* normally very careful whom I email about what..I cannot remember committing such a crime before...but that doesn't excuse what I have done.

The point is, how I am feeling pales in comparison with how the other person must be feeling...

Why am I such a KLUTZ! Yes, I realize that I am not alone, and that it was a slip...but that doesn't make things better at all.

I could easily walk under a cockroach, with room to spare.


***********

I just got an email from someone pointing out a factual error in a post that I had made on Citizen Matters. I sent an apology to the person...and it bounced. But I was able to rectify the error immediately online.

I *wish* the other mistake could  be rectified like that,simply and easily!

:(((((
