I had posted about this lovely all-purpose commandment some time ago...

Yesterday, on the hill road leading to Galibore, I found another GW (General Warning):



<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/20401428@N08/2114565917/" title="you are warned galibore 161207 S3 by pctrsglr, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2059/2114565917_4f2a020d26_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="you are warned galibore 161207 S3" /></a>


I can just imagine a carload of visitors seeing this and falling silent, as each one of them starts worrying about the sins committed...the driver, for example, fretting about running that last red light, the little boy in the back seat about that chocolate he took from his classmate...

Wonder why this was put up, it wasn't one of the religious evangelical things, because it was part of a series of stone-engraved signs about hairpin bends and other road conditions.
