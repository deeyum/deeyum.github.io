....



Want to see the things that caught my eye? My favourite is actually the tree and the etching of the Ashoka Pillar on the glass....

<lj-cut text="several pics if you click on this">



Well...this tree and the benches under it made such a beautiful picture, so calm and inviting.....it illustrates the calm and beauty of Lalbagh (today was much more crowded, obviously!) I am a real tree person, I should change my LJ name to Dogmatix...must ask <lj user="jace"> how to do it....

In the Glass House, there were the various displays of skill with flowers and other natural materials. Here is a Ganesha made with palm fronds:

this is my favourite...the sight of the Ashoka Pillar emblem on the glass somehow brought home to me what the Independence Day flower show was about...

Another display, with anthuriums, carnations, orchids and asparagus fern..very popular&nbsp; for decorating marriage halls too, nowadays!

I wandered around outside and found these two ladies having a refreshing cuppa near some prize-winning croton displays.

...and here is a floral giraffe which is already (done just yesterday) looking quite sorry for itself...what will it look like by August 15th?

The Earth in Flowers...that purple bird on top is supposed to be the Dove of Peace.....

and lastly, I couldn't resist going and looking for <lj user="sainath">'s spotted owlets...and in spite of the crowds, there they were, two little fluffy feathery balls! I tried cropping the picture and posting it, but for some reason which no doubt one of these youngsters will explain to me soon, it didn't work.....
