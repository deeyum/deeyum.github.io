I cannot eat a "jimjam" biscuit (you know, the ones which have jam peeping out of a hole in the biscuit) without nibbling all around it, and coming to the jam right at the end, and...yummmm....

And I have to check myself from opening the orange and bourbon cream biscuits and scraping off the butter cream and eating it alone...

When a neighbour complained about her children doing this, I looked, I think, very guilty, and scuttled off without supporting her.

Anyone else wants to share such shameful (or shameless) secrets?

Been tooooo lazy to upload pictures to Photobucket...must do my Hampi post soon...
