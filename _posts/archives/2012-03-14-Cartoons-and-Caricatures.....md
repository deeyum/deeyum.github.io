Sridhar Comaravalli is someone I've got to know through FaceBook, and I enjoy his talent very much. It's not easy to produce a cartoon every day, but he seems to do it with ease! I was very honoured when, recently, he posted this cartoon of me on FaceBook, from a photograph taken by the Indian professional woman wildlife photographer,

He's moved to Bangalore from Nagpur, and he's an avid birder, too; he was with us for the Bird Race this year. In person, he comes across as so quiet...and there is this wonderful sense of humour lurking!  I'd called him when I went to see the exhibition of

...it was a collection of hitherto unpublished cartoons, notes  and sketches ,at the Indian Institute of Cartooning. 

I love cartoons and caricatures, and it takes great talent to be able to do something like that...so creative, and yet full of humour.
