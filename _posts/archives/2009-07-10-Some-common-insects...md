A macro lens makes you look at the insect world...with fresh eyes. I may never take the kind of wonderful pictures that

 <a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com"> Karthik </a>

takes with that macro lens and that keen eye...but here are my attempts!

I've already posted about the 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/554201.html"> bug season </a>

...but I thought I'd capture the everyday bugs, too!

Let's start with this very tiny

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly"> FLY </a>
 (update: <LJ user="siniak_castle"> says it's a DRAIN FLY)


 that A found on the washbasin of the women's room in the World Bird Sanctuary! It's actually the size of a pinhead...but just look at those feathery feelers, and those gauzy wings!

<lj-cut text="a few more of 'em critters">


Next on the scale is the

 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housefly"> HOUSEFLY </a>

 which got into the house much to A's disgust...and which she got rid of, but not before I got on camera!

Then came this insect which was as large as my hand...it *looks* like a mosquito, but surely, no

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"> MOSQUITO </a>,



<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2657.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2657.jpg" border="0" alt="090709 mosquito?"></a>



 not even Texas ones, can be as large as that??

That's actually a CRANE FLY ( to rhyme with Drain Fly, no doubt!)



I have seen

 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araneomorph_funnel-web_spider"> FUNNEL WEB SPIDERS </a>

 many times, but never on top of a bush like this:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2633.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2633.jpg" border="0" alt="funnel spider web on bush debaliviere 090709"></a>

They are everywhere nowadays, as I walk...and so are the really *extremely* loud 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada"> CICADAS </a> 

 in the trees!


Well, those are all "nasty" insects, so here's a really beautiful one...Karthik tells me it's the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limenitis_arthemis"> RED-SPOTTED PURPLE </a>

(at last, a butterfly name that makes sense!)

There it was, glowing on the side of the road in
