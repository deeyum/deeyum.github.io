In their unfailing annual miracle, the dead garden suddenly started looking green and bright, and the irises grew tall, put forth buds, and began to flower. 

I brought a few indoors, and they are so beautiful....

I bought daisies, carnations, and chrysanthemums from the Farmers' Market, and now the dining area looks so lovely and colourful, just the way I like it!


(I'll post pics of those flowers, too....if you like.)
