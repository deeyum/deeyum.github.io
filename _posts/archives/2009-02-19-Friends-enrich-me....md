I am lucky in my friends, and each enriches me in different ways. Here's one treasure from <LJ user="kshah">:


“The Farmer’s Life”
via Futility Closet by Greg Ross on 2/19/09

The farmer leads no E Z life;
The C D sows will rot;
And when at E V rests from strife
His bones all A K lot.

In D D has to struggle hard
To E K living out:
If I C frosts do not retard
His crops there'll B A drought.

The hired L P has to pay
Are awful A Z, too;
They C K rest when he's away,
Nor N E work will do.

Both N Z can not make to meet,
And then for A D takes
Some boarders who so R T eat
& E no money makes.

Of little U C finds this life;
Sick in old A G lies.
The debts he O Z leaves his wife.
And then in P C dies.

– Anonymous, The Indiana School Journal, August 1886

Allergy in the Letters of the English Alphabet

    
        September 4th, 2007

    Feeling rather down tod-A
    My ear looks as if it was stung by a B
    Out of my right eye I can hardly C
    Normally my health is robust and har-D
    Health issues don't normally trouble m-E
    Today, though, I feel blind and d-F
    All because of this aller-G
    Which, in Africa, I seemed to c-H
    Sometimes it's itching of the I
    My mood is just as blue as a J
    My spirits on the floor along with the par-K
    This allergy seems to have come from L
    With sneezing, and lots of phl-M
    I wish the doctor would tell me wh-N
    I will be myself again! O,
    That I could be bright once more, and hap-P
    The doc would get a big than-Q
    If I could keep from sneezing for 30 minutes...or an R
    That would make me happy,I conf-S.
    I would behave with sani-T
    Instead of hiding from people's v-U
    As I scratch and look comtase and hea-V
    (Hmm..I don't know how to write the W
    In my literary muscles I don't have fl-X!)
    I feel so dull..I wonder Y
    I have to struggle with this aller-Z...
    (Oh, do you pronounce Z as Z?
    OK, there's that pronounciation, instead!)

I like word-play...and letter-play, too! :)
