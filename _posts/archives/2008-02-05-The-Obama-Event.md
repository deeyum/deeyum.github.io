Here's a sign on the wall of the <a href="http://www.explorestlouis.com/edwardJonesDome/public.asp  "> Edward Jones Dome </a> :

Here's the <a href="http://www.gatewayarch.com/Arch/"> Gateway Arch  </a> and the <a href="http://www.slfp.com/OldCourthouse.html">  Old Courthouse building </a> , they were close to where the event was being held:

<lj-cut text="pics of an evening">

And this is the (OOF-Out Of Focus) pic of the venue, I took it while jumping down from a fence:

The crowd wrapped around the building where the venue was, and here's the crowd  going in:

 There were some people who were supporting another candidate:

Capitalism was at its active best as we moved down the queue...here's capitalism with a "t"....

Here's money exchanging hands...

And here are Obama buttons on sale:

Here are the crowds inside the dome:

There were all sorts of people; here's a beautiful young woman and her even more lovely daughter:

And here's one I enjoyed taking, I am sorry to say (I am not sorry about posting this, the young woman was in a  public space, sitting like that!)...what an ad for Levi Strauss!

Several officials came and they were fixing up wires all over the place:

Here's the jewellery on one of the volunteers; she said she has been backing Obama since 1994:

Cheerleaders and a band from Harriet Stowe University put up a nice show:

Finally, Obama appeared and started speaking. The acoustics were so bad that we could not understand a WORD that he said. But the crowd kept cheering nonetheless!

We felt we had quite enough of a campaign stop experience and came out, visiting the Gateway Arch by night, and came home



Here's Obama's campaign tagline:

And since they didn't allow any food or drink to be brought from outside, the prices inside were obviously somewhat inflated:

We felt we had quite enough of a campaign stop experience and came out,and passed the famous sculpture at one of the gates of the Zoo..that's one part of the sculpture, and the S3 is NOT a great camera for night photography...

We then went to TGIF, where this waiter was getting ready to join in the Mardi Gras that was on at a different location, with his multicoloured beads:

We returned home at nearly midnight, and I think we would have been better off in front of the TV...but it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience!
