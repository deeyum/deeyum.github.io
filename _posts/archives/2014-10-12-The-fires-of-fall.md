Fall is a time when red seems to appear everywhere, amongst the green.

Leaves turn into rubies:

The brown tree-trunks are studded with gems:

It seems as if the fires are warming the trees one last time, before the cold, and the monochromes of winter, set in.

Truly, the fires of fall could be called the flames of the forest.
