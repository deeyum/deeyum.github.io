Hi everyone,

I am not immune to FB posts, so when there was a sudden rush of bird sightings from Yediyur kere, I realized that I'd not visited for many years. When Padma and Ramaswamy suggested going there this morning, I was very happy to join them. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/32820579473/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9059"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2825/32820579473_5d590e473c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_9059"></a>

So many trees have fresh leaves right now, like this Peepal tree:

I still wish we could have an ongoing online form for the lake census and keep adding our data whenever we visit any kere. This lake is maintained well, and the water quality seems good. However, the fact of its being completely fenced around, and having all growth stunted
to bush size except for a few spots, made it feel more "manicured" than I am comfortable with...but that's a matter of personal choice!

A seat that cannot be accessed!

We entered the area to a rising orchestra of White-cheeked Barbets, and the unmusical calls of Rose-ringed Parakeets as they flocked to the Akasha Mallige, Peepal and Dolichendrone trees. As we slowly started moving along the path, we were treated to the sights and sounds of several Koels; whether the bodies were black or spotted, the ruby eyes were the same.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/33250653090/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9079"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3934/33250653090_fc4ccc1cc9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_9079"></a>

We were, of course, prepared for the "usual gang of suspects" after which our birding group is named; but as always, something unexpected, and something interesting, happened!

We were watching both a group of Spot-billed Ducks and some domesticated mallard-derivatives (I don't know the correct name for these interbreeds!) when suddenly, a group of drakes decided to "advance" on a female. She sank into the water under their combined
onslaught. She managed to flap her way away from the other three, but a fourth was very persistent, and made quite a nuisance of himself. It was obvious that the lady was not willing.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/32820646513/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9098"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2907/32820646513_dc7f068ca4.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="IMG_9098"></a>

Another duck, who saw the fracas,suddenly decided to come to her friend's aid. She flapped her wings at the drake until he released the besieged duck, and both the ladies happily swam away, at the end of a successful rescue mission! We could not help laughing even as we
watched intently.

A Black-crowned Night Heron skulked under a Lantana bush in the middle
of the  lake.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/33505317911/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9090"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2888/33505317911_9b5e1b5d24.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="IMG_9090"></a>

 An unexpected sighting was that of a Spotted Owlet as it flew for a short distance out of the large Ficus benjamina trees, and back in.

One Dolichendrone tree close to the entrance suddenly seemed to become a hotbed of small-bird activity.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/33636264425/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9106"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2870/33636264425_182244e0ea.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_9106"></a>

 The seed-pods, with their typical spiralling shapes, had already set, and there were no flowers...but yet, Sunbirds, Tailorbirds, Pale-billed Flowerpeckers, a Blyth's Reed
Warbler, and some Ashy Prinias...all kept the tree literally "hopping", and we were able to listen to their calls, too. These are occasions when one can practice birding "by ear", and have the id validated by what one sees.

I was rather intrigued by a brick "bird wall" that had been set up at one place:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/33505254911/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9061"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2826/33505254911_49a2251990.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="IMG_9061"></a>

...and concrete "bird holes" in another "bird corner". It will be fun to see if birds do take up nesting in these holes. But meanwhile, watching Black Kites bringing in twigs to make their homes was interesting enough! A White-throated Kingfisher added its bright blue back and lipstick mouth as it waited for a catch.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/33505315311/in/album-72157678481020563/" title="IMG_9089"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2888/33505315311_7fa85f53e7.jpg" width="500" height="339" alt="IMG_9089"></a>

 It was fun to
watch a Boating Pond Heron...it just sat on one of the boats in the water (kept there to clean the lake, I think), as it scanned the water for breakfast!

Two groups of Rosy Pastors flying overhead, their local cousins, the Common and (the always well-groomed) Jungle Mynas,and the bisyllabic call of one Green Warbler (thank you for the  call tutorials, Mike and Ulhas, they've  been useful!)...between our eyes and ears, we didn't
know where two hours went, and we left the place before the lake was locked up. I will never understand why our lakes and parks are kept locked through the day...what are we trying to prevent?

I did look at a lot of flowers, plants and trees as well:

Finding out names (hoping to remember them, not always successfully!) will occupy me for a while. Watching some hornets beginning to make a nest on the underside of a leaf was also fascinating.

Well satisfied with our morning, we went off for khaali dosa at the excellent eatery (Brahmin's Special, no relation to the Basavanagudi Brahmin's!) near my home, arranging to meet for tomorrow's outing to Hessarghatta Lake.

Spending time with good friends,  looking at many things, under the
shade of greenery, dappled with golden morning sunlight...how lucky I
am to be able to do this!

Hoping to meet some of you tomorrow,

Cheers, Deepa.
