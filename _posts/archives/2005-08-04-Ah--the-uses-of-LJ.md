This should tickle your funny bones....we wanted to book for Jungle Lodges' Dandeli Resort for the coming week. If we have gone to their resorts within the previous 12 months, we get a 10% discount. So I called them up and Murphy's Law mandated that there was no record of our January booking, when I, my spouse, <LJ user="shortindiangirl"> and <LJ user="chaibacca"> the newlyweds, had gone there...

To dig into musty files looking for the receipt was not a welcoming prospect...so I had a brainwave...

went to <LJ user="kalyan">'s blog, looked up his entries for January, when I knew he had referred to our visit....aha!Got the dates and gave it to Jungle Lodges, and lo and behold, their computer brought up the booking too...

Thanks <LJ user="kalyan">, for referring to our visit!
