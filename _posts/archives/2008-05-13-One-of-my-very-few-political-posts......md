I do not like to post comments about politics or activist activities normally, even though I am involved with some of them and try to do the pitiful little that I can.

But I did go to a political meeting for Citizen Matters, and came away disappointed (and why is *that* not a surprise?)

<a href="http://www.citizenmatters.in/articles/view/172-citizens-meet"> Here's my view of what happened </a>

It was really sad to see an academician of Dr Manmohan Singh's stature spouting political figures, casting  political aspersions, and making political promises (the kind that are normally written on the surface of a pond). Instead of bringing forth leaders whom we can look up to, our political system ensures that even people who are worthy of respect are brought down to the level where the average citizen scorns them....
