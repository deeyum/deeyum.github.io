A brilliant piece of verse;  Suhrita Majumdar Basak says it is a very old verse in Kolkata:

Priyotoma roma, comma, 
Tumi amar hridoye diechcho dolon, semicolon; 
Tokhon amar pocket-e chchilo na cash, dash- 
Amar dirghoswash tomar opor korlo na work,exclamation mark! 

Let me see if I can sort-of-write that in English:


Dearest Roma,comma,
It's love for you that lets me roll on, semicolon;
Alas, my pockets lack any cash,dash-
So my love remains in the dark, exclamation mark!

I enjoy clever stuff like this :)
