Here are some of the birds we saw; with the exception of a few, they are all birds that can be seen just outside Bangalore, too! But it was no less enjoyable to sight them in distant Madhya Pradesh.


The SIBERIAN STONECHAT (male)....

A couple of COLLARED SCOPS OWLS, peacefully sitting in the tree:

Later, we saw just one in the tree:

A LITTLE GREBE, making lovely patterns in the water:

WHITE-RUMPED VULTURES feeding off a predator's kill:

and landing on a tree nearby:

A RUFOUS TREEPIE feeding:

This bird would NOT give us a good shot all the time we were at Kanha; but when we had packed our cameras, and took the taxi on the ghat road from Kanha down towards Nagpur, sat in the light  at at least seven places and I swear they were all smiling mockingly at us, I want to call it the Mockingbird!

Let me digress a little here to show some lovely birds which we were able to see in the middle of Pune city, before we went to Kanha:



The INDIAN GREY HORNBILL:

The COPPERSMITH BARBET, which is becoming much more scarce in Bangalore than its cousin, the small green (white-cheeked) barbet:

Let's get back to Kanha....


The birds which I saw for the first time, and have not seen  in Karnataka (I don't know, they may be residents/visitors here too; it's just that *I* haven't seen them here!):

The LESSER ADUTANT STORK:

The ALEXANDRINE PARAKEET:

The SIRKEER MALKOHA, of which I could not get a better shot than this silhouette:

The BLACK-HOODED ORIOLE:

And the CHANGEABLE HAWK EAGLE (also called the crested hawk eagle), though I have seen it before in Karnataka, needs some time to be spent on it, it's such a handsome, majestic bird....once, on a birding trip with Sainath, we spotted it JUST after my camera battery died...and I have waited for another photo-op like this! We saw both the male and female in their nest, which they were busy building up, and one or the other would come out to perch on the branches of one or two trees nearby, and even when they were in the shade, it was delightful to photograph them:

Here's the final photo, of the Hawk Eagle calling to the mate....on INW, I titled this, "Hey! Why don't you come and help with the housework?"

Hope you enjoyed the avian tour of Kanha and Pune!
