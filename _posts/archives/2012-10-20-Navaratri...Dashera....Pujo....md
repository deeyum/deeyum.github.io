Going around, visiting my friends and also checking out the condition of lakes, I got some images I'd like to share with you. No LJ cuts in this post!

One of my friends, Hema, has a simple "golu" this time, without the kalasha that would make it mandatory for her to stay home all the nine days and offer worship:

Here she is, contemplating it:

Here's the rangoli she's done for it:

and the decorated plate for it:

Another of my friends, Arun, helped his mother set up a traditional golu, with the village next to the steps, and all the dolls on them, being symbolic of the universe that the Goddess rules:

Near Konanakunte Lake, I saw this Pujo pandal:

The images had their faces covered, and would have been uncovered today (Shashti Day):

Already, trade and commerce had begun, with a little girl selling mud lamps:

My friend Mythreyi has dolls that are over 20 years old:

But when I went to visit my friend Nandini's home, I found that her daughter, Priya, and her talented grandchildren, Meghna and Shashank, had gone a great job.

The vertical screen was also beautifully done:

However, what totally enraptured me was...Bangalore in the golu!

You can see the centre of our city, with the Metro, the Indoor Stadium, U B City, Utility Building, and the trees which still stand....

Here, have a better view of the Sheshadri Memorial Library and the High Court....a Universe in a doll's world!

I enjoy visiting golus and sharing them with everyone!
