Yesterday I was chatting with my friend 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/505440.html"> Chandu </a>

 as he and Ramesh were supposed to come birding with me. He said, "Ramesh can't come as his wife has gone out and he has to take care of the maid." 

"Oh," I said, "I understand. Yesterday, someone I went birding with had to run home to catch the cook."

...then we both just broke up laughing!
