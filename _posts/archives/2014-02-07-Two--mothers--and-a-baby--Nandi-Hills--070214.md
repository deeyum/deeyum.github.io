I often notice that two, and sometimes three, female Bonnet Macaques join together to care for a baby. This morning, at the Nursery area in Nandi Hills, I watched these two females. The one on the right is the "actual" mother; you can see the afterbirth, still, around her tail.

The baby is still wet from the birth and looks quite rat-like. The two seem to be checking him out. Surprisingly, with such a tender little one to care for, they were both sitting on the ground, right out in the open. I must google whether monkeys give birth on trees or on the ground...

The experience awed me...it was one of many wonderful things we saw, Kamal and I, this morning, at Nandi Hills.
