Such an uneventful day; neighbours were inaugurating the office of the company they have set up with the help of the parent company in Japan. Attended the inauguration and the dinner at the Taj Gateway in the evening....and spent time with friends. How lovely it is to have no major worries, and spend such good time together! Nothing to write about actually means that I am contented and very happy...surely something to write about!
