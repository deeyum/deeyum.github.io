Here are a few photographs of two Eagles that we saw on  our Bandipur trip; I had not set my camera properly and so some of the photographs are a little disappointing. (I also seem to have focused sometimes above, below, or near the subject!) But disappointing is not a word that can be used for the trip, with almost every animal and bird just sitting still and posing for us! In fact, rather than just spotting animals, this time we were lucky enough to watch their behaviour for a little while. The only animals who did disappoint us were, predictably, the tiger and the leopard, both of which we missed by just a minute or so...we arrived on the scene to see the visitors in other vehicles still looking raptly at the spot where each animal had just disappeared into the undergrowth!



This is the Crested Serpent Eagle; he was so comfortable that he was stretching his wings as he sat:

Here's the Changeable Hawk Eagle, with his characteristic "Red Indian brave" head feathers:

Photos of other animals like the Terrapin and Mongoose, and the other birds, will follow....I wanted to dedicate one post to the magnificient eagles of our country!
