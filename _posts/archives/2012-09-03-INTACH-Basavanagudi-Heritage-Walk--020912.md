I will write an account of the lovely walk later...still not feeling entirely OK, so procrastination is the order of the day...well, not today, tomorrow, may be!

I am getting spammed SO badly by LJ comments. Since about 150 people read my blog, I do NOT want to make this friends-only. What should I do? I still love LJ and like posting here. Any suggestions?
