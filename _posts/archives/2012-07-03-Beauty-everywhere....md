To most gardeners, insects on their plants means bad news, and something that must be dealth with drastically.

But when I went to snip off the infected parts of the Clematis climber in the back yard, the little insects looked SO beautiful....

I could not help photographing them before snipping off parts of the creeper.

However, I don't know whether I should be sad, or glad, that these little creatures seem to be back in force! Oh well, off I go with the garden scissors now...
