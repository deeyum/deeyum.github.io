....

Flickr, where I used to post my pictures before posting them on LJ, used to tell me things like "you have posted 2% of your month's quota" or stuff like that. Now, suddenly, it says I have posted 200 photos and now the older ones will be hidden until and unless I upgrade to a paid account. I have tried deleting the older pictures but that doesn't seem to work, it says I must delete my newest uploads ( I don't know why!).

If I delete a pic that I have posted on LJ I will get a blank display on LJ, as I have experienced. 

<lj user="sainath"> suggested that since I am using Picasa on my laptop, I upload to Picasa web albums. But I spent all morning trying unsuccessfully to upload; I dont' know enough to understand why I am unable to (I was uploading only 4 pics!)...

I want to know, if I have my pics on my hard disk, is there a way I can directly post them to LJ? 

Can I open a new account with Flickr and use that (or will it log my IP address and refuse)?

Oh, the difficulties that come with ignorance....I have some pics I took of the examples of bad design on the Jayadeva flyover vis-a-vis bus stops, and I am not able to post the pics....

If someone could help, I would be very grateful!
