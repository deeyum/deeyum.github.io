Coming back after several days' absence is very tough on the LJ friends list, because I do want to read what every friend has posted. And all these friends always decide that they WILL post, and post utterly interesting stuff, the MINUTE I go travelling. I have to read and backtrack, and am still not sure that I might not have missed something....and of course, the worst is that with so many posts to read (and this BSNL broadband getting spottier all the time) I can't respond and comment and debate....
