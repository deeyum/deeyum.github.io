Though <LJ user="kalyan"> tells me that SHIKRAs are pretty common in <strike> Bangalore </strike> Bengaluru, I have never seen this bird inside the city limits before.

This evening, I was walking along and it was nearly 7 pm, and what do I see but this handsome bird sitting on the railing of the Mini Forest that abuts my home!

It was lucky and unlucky that I had my S3 with me; lucky because I had any camera at all, and unlucky because the S3 is not the best camera either for low-light situations or for bird photography... I wish it had been the Canon with the prime lens! Also, it was *really* low light...

But the bird didn't fly too far, and these are the shots that I managed:

I am hoping that this bird will be around, and I can photograph it with a better camera in better light!

Update.

I posted this collage on INW too, and got a fantastic comment from someone who had this to say:


"good picture...could make out it is a kannada bird easily by seeing the board."

Still laughing....!
