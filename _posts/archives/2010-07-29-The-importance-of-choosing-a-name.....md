A rose by any other name will smell as sweet, wrote the Bard (or words to that effect, before some literal-minded reader corrects it!)...but no, I think it's very important to choose names properly...

Just now, on a mailing list I belong to, someone wrote, very excitedly:


" XYZ just got its page up on Facebook !!!! YAHOO!!!!!"

Wonder what the owners of FB would have to say about that...and wonder if the other IT company ever realized that theirs would be a name taken during moments of glee!
