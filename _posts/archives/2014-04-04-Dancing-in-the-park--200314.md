There is a park close to KM's apartment where children are charged Rs.5 each for entry (adults get in free)..this goes, I think, towards maintenance of the playground equipment. At one edge of the small park is a stage, and children can dance to the music. Both the Boodi and the Booda had a great time there, in spite of recurrent fever and fretfulness.

Trust is a matter of learning to fall into one's grandfather's arms.

Though the visit was full of fever,work, and was not relaxed, we still had some wonderful moments...and I miss them so!
