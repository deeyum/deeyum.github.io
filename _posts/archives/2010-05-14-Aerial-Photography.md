I enjoy taking photographs from aircraft:

<lj-cut text="the wing, and the sights">


and particularly, I like it when I can get the wing in the photo, too. The wing adds perspective to the image, and when I started wondering just what the wing was made up of, the ailerons came up as the plane landed, and I got a view of the complex innards:

The wing, indeed, comes with clear instructions (for maintenance engineers, but these would be very good to follow when the plane is in flight, too.)

I can see the complex system of highways that connects the US of A and makes it that great flower, the Car-Nation:

I like flying over geographically awesome spots...these are the Rockies...

Their majesty is breath-taking:

Some shapes, such as these 'stars' on the mountains near Salt Lake City, are intriguing:

The salt in the Salt Lakes that give Salt Lake City its name, show up in a medley of colours:

On the way back, the rainclouds descended on the mountains near Salt Lake City:

The colours of the sky and earth are also beautiful when seen from an aircraft, almost Impressionist in their melting appearance:

Aerial photography helps me photograph urban landmarks, too...here's the Coronado Bridge at San Diego:

Here's a scene that any self-respecting Arab would love...all those gas-guzzling cars, PLUs an even more  gas-guzzling aircraft!
