Under the summer sun
And the fleecy clouds,
The prairie flowers bloom.
Before the day is done
There will be crowds
Of insects, fighting for room
On the blossoms, to partake
Of the nectar so sweet.
Wings help the creatures make
Quick landings with six feet.
A scene of quiet and serenity
Appears to our eyes;
But the fast-paced activity
Of the insects is seen by the wise.

Coneflowers, Bee's Balm and other flowers on the prairie, Lewis and Clark State Historical Center, Hartford, Illinois, 270713.
