Finally, because I had company, I went to Hypnos today...and I must say, the experience leaves me cold. The dance floor was practically non-existent; the food was good but very pricey; I don't like liquor and it seemed as it it had rained heavily in my Pina Colada; and we could not hear a word of conversation through the thundering music (which was pretty good though.) I was told that lounge bars avoid the smoke and loud music and have an intimate atmosphere where you can listen to quiet music and have a convivial drink. My generation has another alternative to lounge bars..it's called home. You put on (or sing) nice music, have a few drinks with good friends, and perhaps eat at home or go out...no smoke, no noise, no crowd of strangers....I am afraid I will never understand the point of lounge bars!
