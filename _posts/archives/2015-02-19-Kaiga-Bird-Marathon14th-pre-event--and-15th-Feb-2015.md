<lj-cut text="a long description of our team at the Kaiga Bird Marathon">

On the eve of the event, some of us met up at the Nisarga Guest House:

Here we are, admiring the photographs of Mr Puttaraju, the one holding the megaphone.

Neha of BNHS spotted this Spotted Deer (Chital) stag on the opposite bank of the Kali river.

The iconic bird of the area, the Malabar Pied Hornbill, made a flypast in the gathering dusk

Mr Raju Kasambe made me see three of them!

We watched some birds in the garden.

This Purple-rumped Sunbird was one.

Good photos of birds are always a draw, too!

Now, to the actual event!

We gathered in the pre-dawn dark, under the crescent moon

on the 15th of February, in the garden of the guest house:

I led team Rufous Treepie on Transect G (the 8th of 8 transects)...which was the Virje area, comprising the Kali river backwaters, some forest and village patches.

The scene at the backwaters was very beautiful, in the breaking dawn

Here we are, looking for birds at various spots.

We started with the Malabar Pied Hornbill, and then the White-bellied Sea Eagle sailed across the water.

The Stork-billed Kingfisher was unmistakable, even in the distance.

I got this shot of a flowering mango tree and a Fishtail Palm:

This un id plant was fleshy, and thick with sticky sap

We walked through homes with flowering jasmine:

I wondered if I would spot a Spiderhunter on this banana flower:

I was told that this is the rAmphal, a relative of the sItAphal (custard apple)

Some homes had pineapples growing, too!

Soumyashree gifted this winged seed to her husband Prashantha Kumar, and he lovingly sported it on his cap for the rest of the transect.

The scenes as we walked through the transect:

We also looked at the traditional wooden architecture of storage barns:

The young men from the Forestry College, Sirsi, interacted with village children in a very friendly way.

The young men also pointed out this Civet scat, but without the coffee beans that turn into

Unfortunately, the high price of this coffee has resulted in some horrible practices,

They also showed me their impeccable field notes:

The temple had mechanically operated drums.

the hOma kuNdA looked lovely.

There was a navagraha hOmA going on, and I sat peacefully, listening to the mantrAs being chanted.

As I sat there, several raptors, including the White-bellied Sea Eagle, soared past.

Here's the representation of the Nuclear Power Plant, which I hope to get permission to visit the next time!

We came back to the guest house and collated our sightings.

(I think we got 75 species of birds.)

I was the only person who also submitted a butterfly list :D

We had a nice evening gathering, with the organizers officiating.

We took the overnight sleeper bus back to Bangalore!

MyeBird list  for the 15th, the actual event, is

I could not be happy about the event become competitive, with rankings being announced. However...the count of 247 species from the 15th of February, 2015, still indicates that the area in and around Kaiga is good, environmentally. I also counted so many butterflies when I wasn't even looking for them; so I must agree that Kaiga is a great
place for birders to visit!

I'll close with this beautiful Asian Fairy Bluebird, that lives up to its name.

I hope you enjoyed the Kaiga Bird Marathon as much as we did!
