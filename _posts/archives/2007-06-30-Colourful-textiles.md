I do love the bright colours that&nbsp; we always prefer, in our clothing and textiles. Textile and saree shops are always so colourful; and here's a little pushcart I found a few days ago, selling what I would like to call "rainbow towels"

I somehow think there is a connection between the warmth of the climate and the colourfulness of clothes...the brightest hues are to be found in Rajasthan...
