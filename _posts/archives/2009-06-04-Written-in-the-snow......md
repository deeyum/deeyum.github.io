It was great to see Oriental languages in the snow at Yosemite...

First, the Tamizh messages:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_1167.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_1167.jpg" border="0" alt="vazhga vaLamudan"></a>


"vAzhga vaLamudan"  (may you live and prosper) says the message, adding "enjay" for good measure!


This one says "jOthi ishai" (light and music):


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_1169.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_1169.jpg" border="0" alt="jOthi ishai snow"></a>


Apparently they were made by the Aradhya family:

A major source of disappointment was this message in Kannada:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_1168.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_1168.jpg" border="0" alt="vinu heart deepa yosemite 300509"></a>


Vinu  *heart* Deepa, it says. I never got to meet Vinu and test his/her truly *melting* love!

There was also this message in the Japanese/Chinese Kanji script:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_1173.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_1173.jpg" border="0" alt="kanji lettering 300509"></a>

Even <LJ user="asakiyume"> and <LJ user="wakanamori"> were not able to say what those characters mean! 

So...oriental languages, and a message of love...who ever thought that I would see my own name in the snow in transient graffiti?
