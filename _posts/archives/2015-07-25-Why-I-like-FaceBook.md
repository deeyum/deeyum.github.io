At well-past-eight, with the setting sun
The day's work and outings are all done.
How nice it is to take a peek
At what my friends have done, all week.
There may be those who've moved the earth
There may be those who've just proved their worth
In simple, everyday, tiny deeds.
News about you is just what I need.
Thank you, my friends...each shared word
Through my eyes, in my heart is heard.
I'm off to sleep; the world does not end
Nor sets the sun  on a place without a friend.
