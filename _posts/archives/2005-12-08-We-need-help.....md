We bought a wireless router in the US, and it was checked out as working OK...and we also bought wireless cards for each of our laptops; now the router doesn't work and our wireless seems more hopeless as the days pass....if anyone knows someone who can help us out....HELLLLPPP!!!!I wish we knew enough about software to help ourselves, but we don't....
