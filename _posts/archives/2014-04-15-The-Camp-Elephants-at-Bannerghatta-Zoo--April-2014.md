Having gone thrice to the zoo area in the  course of a week, I was able to see the camp elephants being brought back from their foraging trips in the periphery of the Bannerghatta forest area.

I must say, I am very impressed with the health of these camp elephants, and their excellent relationships with their mahouts.

They are helped by their mahouts...the second one is just about settling down!

Look at the little one nuzzling up!

The amount of dust that a female human being would instantly set about cleaning, seems welcome to a female elephant!

A young one comes along curiously (she's called Roopa):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837207463" title="DSC02140 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5169/13837207463_8d26bff747.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02140"></a>

There's work to be done...this wood has to be carried inside the zoo, but neither youngster is doing to do that (just like humans!)

The little one, indeed, roots along happily:

They start walking towards the rear entrance of the zoo:

Here's a short video of their gait:

It's left to the adults to bring the baled wood:

The elephant's trunk and mouth are such amazing things!

Obediently, El Nino follows his mother and aunts:

Now, it is the turn of the tusker (in India, only male elephants have tusks) to come and settle down:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837274415" title="DSC02154 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/13837274415_d2570c52c5.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02154"></a>


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837284975" title="DSC02155 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3766/13837284975_b46a7a2741.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02155"></a>

Not an appealing sight, the rear of an elephant? I found it quite interesting...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837328273" title="DSC02156 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2813/13837328273_f80cdea779.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02156"></a>

Because, as the mahout dusted him down, I saw a part of an elephant I've never seen before (no, not THAT, you dirty-minded lot!)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837679624" title="DSC02157 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/13837679624_71c9113ace.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02157"></a>

The soles of an elephant's feet!

This tusker is called "Vanaraja" (King of the Forest):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13837355023" title="DSC02159 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/13837355023_c38ebf6159.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="DSC02159"></a>

After his dust bath, he headed in the opposite direction, back into the forest periphery:

Here's the tusker getting up:

We watched him as he swayed off, majestically:

After being brought back into the Zoo, they seemed to be very happy in their enclosure:

Throwing dust over themselves, or dusty stuff, seems to be a way of relaxing:

The unnamed baby was especially happy, lolling about in the fodder:
