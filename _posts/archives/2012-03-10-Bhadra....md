The Bhadra property of JLR is one of their most beautiful. However, there are the minuses....eturning from a3 day trip, with hundreds of photos.....and a huge sense of relief that our boat did not (as it threatened to, for a few moments, after the boatman carelessly rammed into a submerged tree-stump)capsize during the backwater safari.....great company, lovely, leisurely sightings, and lot of happiness in my heart.


Photos will appear soon...but meanwhile, the joy of sitting for long, serene hours, in the light of the newly-risen full moon, in the mysterious silvery monochrome light....will remain with me, as I head back to the city.
