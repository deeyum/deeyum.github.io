Opened the Hindu Metro Plus to find an article on <LJ user="rohan_kini"> and his friends, not about the <a href="http://www.bumsonthesaddle.com/"> Bums on the Saddle </a> start-up (though that is laudable in itself) but about <a href="http://rohan-kini.livejournal.com/88993.html"> his initiative to plant more trees in Bangalore </a> . 

I wish we had thousands of young men like these in our city!
