The IISc campus is always beautiful to walk in; the tree canopy meets overhead, so even on the hottest of days, one walks through a dim green light.

We had gone to the Centre for Ecological Studies, to see the documentary by David Attenborough being screened (this one was about how various insects, after long periods in the water or the undergrowth, take to the air)...and in front of the building was this amazing vine. What a beautiful abstract  picture it makes against the wall...

What vine it is, I do not know, but it's  most amazing, twisting and turning as it grew:

Here's another view of it against another part of the building wall:

Here's the trunk where it comes up from the ground; it's twisted and spiralled over what must have been the original trunk of the tree supporting it:

And here's a view of it from a little distance, looks like an explosion of spirals!

It's hard and woody and quite old now, and incredibly beautiful!
