Since David Frye, of Detroit, Michigan, had contacted Chandu to go to Hoskote, Thomas, his son Aakash, and I also joined in from south Bangalore.

We crossed the K R Puram bridge as dawn was breaking:

This palm tree was  bouncing an orange ball as we reached the lake:

The lake was a mirror:

There were an amazing number of swallows on the "bund" or the shore of the lake.

Here's my short video of the surfeit of swallows:

Here are two, preening:

They sat on the dried-up trees in the lake, too:

David Frye and Chandu arrived as we were observing the birds:

I was very impressed with his sketching and documentation:

Here's our little group against the morning sun:

L to R: Chandu, David, Vignesh( who also arrived at the same time), Thomas, and Aakash.

On the lake bed, we found an ex-crab:

We consulted to get id's....

Especially one bird that was a lifer for me, the

COMMON GREENSHANK:

Meanwhile, Sanjeev Managoli also drove up on his way to his teaching duties, and in his car, I saw this delightful Ganesha, with a laptop and a mouse:

We took a brefus break, and here are all of us:

And here's IVC (Iddli, Vada, Coffee!)

Suvarchala, Chandu's wife, had made these delicious gulab jamuns, so we ate them, too:
