The less hair men have on their heads, the more likely they are to have a beard.

 Alas, I can straightaway think of two exceptions...<a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com"> this guy </a> and <a href="http://spexyguy.blogspot.com/"> this one </a>....

Also <a href="http://cybersurg.livejournal.com"> this one </a>.

All generalizations, including this one, are likely to be wrong. *smiles evil smile*

OK, off to do my morning chores!
