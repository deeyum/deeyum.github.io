On an egroup to which I belong, someone had typed, "XYZ gets invited too the ABC event". And someone found fault with that...here's what the second someone said:

"just out of curiosity, why you use "too" everywhere instead of "to", coz the whole grammer is going for a toss..."

Does this second someone know that the 'correct' spelling of 'coz' is because? And that it's grammar, not grammer?

It's when I find fault with others that my own become so glaringly visible!
