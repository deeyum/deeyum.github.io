The memories locked in each heart
Could bring so many joys..
It could take us back to golden times
When we could be happy, and rejoice.

But if the past that's in my brain
Is likely to cause me pain...
It's not surprising if I lack
The ability to often look back.

I'll not turn and look at the past
When each present day is better than the last.
My heart for peaceful serenity strives:
Not to remember pain in my, and others', lives.
