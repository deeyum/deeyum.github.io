I used to enjoy a series called "Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?" and I am offering no prizes for guessing whete these snaps were taken...

I was very tickled by this ad for a wind-energy company (we waited 4 hours for our connecting flight, so I roamed around the airport a bit...)

The next one is in St Louis; I took an enjoyable afternoon walk. It's so lovely to stride out briskly in the cold weather (there's no snow):

That's actually at a bus terminus near my daughters' home....there's also a fire station and here's the shiny fire engine, it was just moving out as I passed:

Will post a few more things that I saw on my walk today....if only I could go to sleep...!
