Then, of course, we faced east to welcome the rising sun:

I just thought, the sun is always a nice full circle...

then, ofkose, it happened.

Clouds touched the sun...

But even that looked as though Nature was smiling!

The clouds looked like flames across the face of the sun...

We went on to the day's outing with our hearts and eyes already full!
