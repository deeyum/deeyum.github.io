There is only one real "parrot" in India, the Vernal Hanging Parrot. (The others are Parakeets). We got to observe a lot of them at Nature's Nest, Canopy Goa, at Tambdi Surla, and I got this video of one feeding off the Powder Puff blossoms:

I like all wildlife (er, except cockroaches, leeches, mosquitoes, rats and ticks) but the "cute" ones certainly have an advantage!
