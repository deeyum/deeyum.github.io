Saw a play today at Ranga Shankara by that name. The play was very good, the two actors (of course it was an actor and an actress, but now that word "actress" is not a good one to use for some reason) were excellent, and we enjoyed ourselves even though every four letter word imaginable and some not-used-even-today-in-daily-conversation six-letter words were strung through the script. It was extremely funny and sometimes also moving.

But there was NO brochure about the play or the troupe, no introduction to the cast, the crew, the director..That part of it was HUGELY unsatisfying.

If you can...go see the play tomorrow at the same venue...and let me know what you thought.
