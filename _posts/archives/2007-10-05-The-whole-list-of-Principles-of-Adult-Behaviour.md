With the permission of <LJ user="udhay">, here's the whole list that I talked about in <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/295045.html">  an earlier post </a> , along with Barlow's introduction:

>I didn't think I would live to 30 either. I was shocked, shocked I
>tell you, to find myself on the eve of my 30th birthday, weirdly
>alive. In this, I was quite out of step with most of my friends to
>that point, more than half of whom were already back in the sweet
>realm of infinity and love. Chickenshits. If you're going to
>volunteer in the first place, go right into the Special Forces.
>
>In any event, it occurred to me that, past 30, I could no longer
>defend my peccadillos on basis of youth. I would have to acquire some
>minimal sense of responsibility. While I didn't want to be a
>grown-up, I wanted at least to act like one in the less toxic and
>stultifying sense of the term.
>
>So, I sat down around 2 am on October 3, 1977 and I drew up this list
>of behavioral goals that I hoped might assist in this process. Now,
>thirty years later, I can claim some mixed success. Where I've
>failed, I'm still working on it. I give these to you so that you can
>provide me with encouragement in becoming the person I want to be.
>And maybe, though they are very personally targeted, they may even be
>of some little guidance to you.

>Anyway, this is what I wrote that night:

PRINCIPLES OF ADULT BEHAVIOR
>
>1.      Be patient.  No matter what.
>2.      Don't badmouth:
>         Assign responsibility, never blame.
>         Say nothing behind another's back you'd be unwilling to say,
>in exactly the same tone and language, to his face.
>3.      Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble
>than yours are to you.
>4.      Expand your sense of the possible.
>5.      Don't trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
>6.      Expect no more of anyone than you yourself can deliver.
>7.      Tolerate ambiguity.
>8.      Laugh at yourself frequently.
>9.      Concern yourself with what is right rather than whom is right.
>10.     Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
>11.     Give up blood sports.
>12.     Remember that your life belongs to others as well.  Do not
>endanger it frivolously.  And never endanger the life of another.
>13.     Never lie to anyone for any reason.
>14.     Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
>15.     Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission
>and pursue that.
>16.     Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
>17.     Praise at least as often as you disparage.
>18.     Never let your errors pass without admission.
>19.     Become less suspicious of joy.
>20.     Understand humility.
>21      Forgive.
>22.     Foster dignity.
>23.     Live memorably.
>24.     Love yourself.
>25.     Endure.
>
>I don't expect the perfect attainment of these principles.  However,
>I post them as a standard for my conduct as an adult.  Should any of
>my friends or colleagues catch me violating any one of them, bust me.

>Perry Barlow

>October 3, 1977

Perry Barlow, obviously, turned 60 on Oct 4 this year...wonder what he thought of turning 60, if he could hardly visualize himself turning 30!

<LJ user="udhay">...any other insights about Barlow, other than the fact that he was one of the first people to whom you sent email?
