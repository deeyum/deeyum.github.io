I have asked <LJ user="asakiyume"> to make up one of her (pun intended) fantastic stories about these two goats I found in the hAt (weekly market) at Miao...

But...any of you can do that...what are the issues that these two are at loggerheads about? What has...got their goat?

Let me know what YOUR story is...
