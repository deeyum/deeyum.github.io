We've all spotted elephants...but have we spotted  spotted elephants?

Here's one:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0716.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0716.jpg" border="0" alt="241209 namdapha spotted elephant"></a>


The spots were done, I was told, with diesel...I did not enquire about the cross on the animal's forehead until later. This is a domesticated elephant, used for quite a lot of work in Namdapha!
