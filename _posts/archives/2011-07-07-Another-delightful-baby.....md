Yesterday I posted the pictures of a little one at home...here's a little one who came and unabashedly looked up at me in Des Peres Creek, in Forest Park!

Danny Brown had introduced me to the place on Des Peres Creek where I could sit patiently and wait for the family of minks to appear; I think it's a mother (and a father, I'm not sure!) and a litter of 3 or 4 babies.

I was very lucky indeed to have this curious little one come out, and here's a video of it going along the river bank:

It's been very hot and muggy and I have not been able to spend a lot of time wandering around Forest Park as I can do at other times of the year! But the mink area is a usual part of my morning walk these days...some lovely birds to see, even if the minks are elusive!
