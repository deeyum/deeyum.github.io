<br /><br />One job in the kitchen that I really *hate*.... chopping cabbage...I&nbsp;tend to slaughter it....<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4330.jpg"><img border="0" alt="red cabbage 120809" src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_4330.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Even MORE so if that cabbage is red and gives me pink fingers...the process becomes even closer to a killing!<br /><br /><br />Then why do I do it? I think, &quot;If I hate it so much, how much will another person also dislike it, especially after coming home tired from work, with a baby to feed several times at night!&quot; and I find I can do it after all....<br /><br />That said, I just *love* that knife in (one *hate* to be balanced by one *love*!) in the picture. When one has a very sharp, good knife, one may fear for the length of one's fingers....but food preparation is a doddle...well...everything except cabbage, I mean! Cabbage...somehow the chopping sort of multiplies as you cut it in slices, you know what I mean? I slice and chop, slice and chop, slice and chop..then there are the big bits to slice and chop yet again... <br /><br />I want to know how each of YOU tackles this chopping-cabbage task....<br /><br /><br />Oh, and we also often have leopard bananas in the kitchen...want to see them?<br /><br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4332.jpg"><img border="0" alt="120809 leopard bananas" src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_4332.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br />That banana stand, I am sure, is from <br /><br /><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/"> IKEA </a><br /><br />...you can also see some ordinary bananas waiting to be hanged, until they are either eaten...or spotted!<br /><br />And the flowers?&nbsp;I&nbsp;*love* flowers, I get them whenever I can. The home always has at least 3 vases of flowers!<br /><br /><br />OK, I stopped the chopping because of an intense desire to share all this with you lot...must finish murdering that cabbage and wash my hands before GD wakes up!<br /><br /><br /><div id="refHTML">&nbsp;</div>
