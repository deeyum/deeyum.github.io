I was lucky that though they count themselves beginners, my teammates at the Bangalore Bird Race are still better than I am at both birding and photography...here are two pictures that <LJ user="anirudhc"> took with the KMC (KM's Canon)....

Here's a majestic Brahminy Kite (the Indian version of the Bald Eagle!) with his fish breakfast; he is reflected in the catchment waters of the Manchinabele Reservoir....

And as <LJ user="amoghavarsha"> stepped a little closer, off he went. I am sure that my teammates, with their software skills, would do a great job of post-processing this photograph, but I am posting it as it is:

I am sure you will all agree that Anirudh is pretty modest about his photography skills! That's one photograph I am going to enjoy looking at, for a long, long time....
