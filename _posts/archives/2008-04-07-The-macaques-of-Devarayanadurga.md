One of the fauna that kept us endlessly entertained at Devarayanadurga was the Bonnet Macaque, which we call the common monkey....

We started by seeing them with their fur aglow in the early morning light....

Even a sleepy yawn looked beautiful:

The males were really enjoying grooming, and being groomed by, each other. Just look at the stance of this guy...if that isn't enjoyment, what is?

It was fun to watch several "family" units like this:

And I concentrated on one mother and child:

Ooh, the little one was shy, and peeped out of his hiding place in Mommy's arms!

Here are two youngsters:

Here's a close-up on one. Macaques must be a very worried lot, can you imagine, all those wrinkles at that young age! :)

While on our way home, we passed the fencing, and near there, found this group of them in their huddling behaviour:

While we watched, another young one came along to join in:

And successfully got into the group, too....

But, suddenly, the female snarled and threw him out....and you can see the disappearing paw as the monkey ran like a flash out of range of the beating!

With these antics, one never knows the time goes! But the rest of our sightings were fantastic too...if EVER this internet connection (no, <LJ user="premkudva"> no loose connections, I wish that were the case!) allows me to post pics to Flickr and post to LJ....
