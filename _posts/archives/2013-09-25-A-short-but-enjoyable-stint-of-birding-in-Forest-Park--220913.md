I got an email from 

<a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~emmq7/Menu/CV/ETM_CV.pdf">Eliot Miller </a>

 that he and his girlfriend Sarah (both postdocs in bird behavior) would be birding in Forest Park in the evening, and I decided to postpone my visit to a birthday party to join them for at least a short while.

As I walked to meet them, I was witness to an altercation (or at the very least, a noisy interaction) between two 

BLUE JAYS

in a tree, which I have posted about

After I met them

 we walked down the path in the prairie area of the park:

Though the sun was still high, there was a fair amount of bird activity in the area. We watched several

EASTERN WOOD PEEWEES

We also saw Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, Indigo Buntings, Thrashers, and  Vireos in the heavy foliage across the creek. The foliage was too thick for photography, so I used my binoculars instead.

The change in the season was quite palpable, and the the first of the fall colours were showing themselves:

Other creatures, which are more "ground-bound", were making their homes (and arrangements for getting dinner):

We didn't see any Mississippi Kites, but we certainly saw this Missouri Kite up a tree!

Several 

AMERICAN GOLDFINCHES

delighted us with their flashes of yellow:

I call this image "flying south" in salute to the millions of birds who do that..

A

MONARCH

Butterfly, one of thousands on their annual journey, was feeding off the New England Asters (Thank you, Lynda Richards, for the id!) :

The Goldenrods and the white wildflowers (Lynda Richards helped me...they are Pilose Asters) spangled our path with yellow and white:

These seed-pods were setting post-flowering and they were beautiful, too:

I thought I saw a raptor, but doubted my sighting when I spotted a

MOURNING DOVE:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9915479693/" title="DSC08434 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/9915479693_d192c39ec1_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC08434"></a>

But no, my sighting was all right...the

AMERICAN KESTREL

too, had landed on the same tree!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9915479303/" title="DSC08436 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/9915479303_0d5c8923d4_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC08436"></a>

An interesting thing happened at the start of our walk. Another couple came along, and asked where they could see the Great Horned Owls, and I told them that they'd have to head over to the Muny. Then, when I mentioned that I was from India, the gentleman immediately said, "Mohan?"...he was

<a href=" http://chambermusicstl.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=54"> Mark Mittleman </a>

an eminent lawyer who is also a keen musician, and is a birder as well!

Apparently he'd read my posts on the Mobirds list (and no doubt had a hearty laugh over my mistakes, though he was too polite to say so!) Here are Eliot and Mark:

We all watched a

NORTHERN FLICKER

for a while:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9915308245/" title="DSC08439 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3741/9915308245_eacf7fbcd9_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC08439"></a>

I wasn't sure if there was a nest, or it was just foraging for insects in the wood of the tree-trunk.

Alas, I had to leave in order to catch my train and go to Creve Coeur, so I bid adieu to Eliot and Sarah, and walked back through the Park, seeing several other people who were enjoying the beauty of the evening:

Forest Park will always be a great treasure house for me...
