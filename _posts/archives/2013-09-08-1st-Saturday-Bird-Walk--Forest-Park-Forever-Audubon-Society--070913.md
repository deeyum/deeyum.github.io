I left for the birding outing as the sun came up.

Forest Park was at its most beautiful....

I enjoyed the grasses on fire with the morning sun:

I watched a 

HAIRY WOODPECKER 

for a while:

I reached the Fish Hatchery:

Jim Wilson gathered us all together, while conferring with Brenda Hente:

We enjoyed the walk...

We went over a piece of heritage ...the Victorian Bridge:

We saw several

GREEN HERONS

like this one, alert for breakfast:

We raised a "chai toast" to Jim Wilson, who's moving on to a new phase of life:

During the walk, we were also delighted by other beings...

this 

LOBELIA CARDINALIA:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9693376141/" title="DSC07278 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9693376141_3fb65b84ab_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC07278"></a>

a

VICEROY

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/9696606074/" title="DSC07272 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7384/9696606074_2ac5ae711d_z.jpg" width="640" height="379" alt="DSC07272"></a>

The Viceroy is a look-alike of the Monarch, and saves itself from predation by looking like a butterfly which is toxic to predators. The very name, "Viceroy", means "instead of the king"...and so, it was fitting that we saw this instead of the Monarch!

Scenes such as this were soothing to the eye...

As Jim gave me a ride home, I spotted this tiny spider on his rear-view mirror, and clicked it while we waited at a traffic signal!

Thank you, St.Louis birders, for another pleasant morning.
