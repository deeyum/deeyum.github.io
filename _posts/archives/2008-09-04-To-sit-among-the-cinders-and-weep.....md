I saw this pile of coke a couple of days ago:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6466.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6466.jpg" border="0" alt="for cinder bg road 020908"></a>

There was no one around to enquire what the going rates were....or how this load came to be dumped there. (That man in the picture was just some random person sitting there.)

What ARE cinders used for? I thought cinders were the remains of coal from a fire, but apparently I am mistaken.


...and that reminds me of Cinderella....who became known by that name because she had to sit amongst the cinders...here's <a href="http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question5458.html"> an entry that gives her real name </a>.

On an egroup I belong to, someone was remarking that in India we often think of domestic help and security personnel, not as employees, but as "servants". How many Cinderellas do we have, who weep in the middle of their daily drudgery, and for whom there will be no ball, fairy godmother, or Prince Charming?
