Nothing brings on a demonstration of affection like a proposed departure I think, especially for a longish time!

It's been lovely to have friends and neighbours visiting, all my friends, whether from the quiz group, the naturalists' group, or...sometimes all those sets intersect...makes me feel how very blessed we are with regard to friends, and what fantastic friends we have! Surely, the greatest treasure that no income tax can take away...

Thank you to every single one of you who called or called on us. Makes us feel warm and happy and loved.
