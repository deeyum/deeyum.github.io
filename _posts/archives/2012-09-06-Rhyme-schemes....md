My lover
Woke me in the middle of the night
With sweet words.
At that hour,
Sleepy, with only the light
Of the moon upon my bed,
I said....
Something that only my lover heard.


The rhyme scheme for this verse is a b c a b d d c.  Does this fit any known rhyming convention? I've been looking into various types of rhyming, scansion and prosody, and

All of you who write so well....what are your thoughts?
