When, in stories, a person "walks into the sunset", there are no pages left in the book (except, perhaps, of a listing of other books by the same author, or similar books.) But in real life...life goes on. There may not be any conclusion of the hopes--and fears-- that the person carries along...and the next sunrise awaits.
