The

is listed as "near-threatened" by IUCN.

We are extremely lucky to have quite a few of these beautiful arboreal animals, about 100km from Bangalore, in the 

<a href="http://www.mapsofindia.com/karnataka/tourism/cauvery-wildlife-sanctuary.html"> Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary </a>

and more specifically, at the

Though KM had the squirrel pointed out to him by Bharat and Alim, who run the adventure activities at the resort, while we were having an afternoon nap, I was feeling bad that Poornima, Kannan and the twins, Suhas and Supriya, had never seen them. So I was thrilled when Tanu, who is on the staff at JLR, told me he's also very interested in these animals, and right at dusk, as we prepared to leave, he called us to see them.

The sun was setting and the light was fading rapidly; and we were, of course, looking directly up into the canopy. But I managed a few shots and videos (and I am sure the others have got much better pictures!).

Here's the squirrel, looking down at us while "on the munch":

Here's the short video I took:

I caught this short bit of the squirrel running and jumping:

Then we were even more delighted...because a baby squirrel came up to be with its mother!

Very happy at having seen this beautiful animal, we left them to their meal in the huge trees of the camp:

We said a "farewell" (literally!) to these two, and made our way home.
