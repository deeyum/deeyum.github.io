This trip to Kabini was a real bonanza in terms of birds; we sighted a 103 or 104 species of birds in the two days that we were there, and also got to observe a lot, rather than just looking and passing on. 

As we drove towards Mysore, we decided to take a little detour through Ranganathittu, not going towards the boating area but towards the old quarry. And of course, we immediately struck a jackpot with several

BLUE-TAILED BEE-EATERS

flying around. One came in, obligingly, with a Cicada in its mouth, and posed for us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4475.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4475.jpg" border="0" alt="bt betr 140511 kbni"></a>

<lj-cut text="several more birds here...we saw 103 or so species, but don&#39;t worry, only a few of those here!">


Meanwhile, high above, a

SHIKRA

soared, looking for food that was not as small as a Cicada:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4492.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4492.jpg" border="0" alt="shkra 140511 kbni"></a>

We saw several 

INDIAN GREY HORNBILLS

around, and one on the tree had just found a fig for breakfast:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4506.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4506.jpg" border="0" alt="indn gry hrnbl 140511 kbin"></a>

The deep pit in the quarry area had a lot of reeds, and of course, reeds mean Weaver birds; in this case, some

STREAKED WEAVERS:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4520.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4520.jpg" border="0" alt="strkd wvr 140511 kbni"></a>

(their triumph of home architecture is on my Facebook album, the link is at the end.)

A wire on the wire...several

WIRE-TAILED SWALLOWS

sat up on the telephone lines, and I caught one:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4535.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4535.jpg" border="0" alt="wr tld swlw kbni 140511"></a>


As we went further, we stopped as we suddenly spotted some 

ALPINE SWIFTS

which were a lifer for me. It was very difficult, indeed, to catch one of these in flight, so there will be no snide remarks about fuzzy photos...one of my usual SMS (Shamelessly Mediocre Shots)!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4541.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4541.jpg" border="0" alt="alpn swft 140511 kbni"></a>

In the fields, of course, 

BLACK IBIS

were walking around feeding on the insects:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4546.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4546.jpg" border="0" alt="blk ibis 140511 kbni"></a>


A sight that truly lifted our hearts (like that of the poet Wordsworth!) was the one of several

CRESTED LARKS

on the ground, or the wires, singing:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4560.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4560.jpg" border="0" alt="crstd lk 140511 kbni"></a>


Gopal's car had stopped, unable to move past this

BLACK-WINGED KITE:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4583.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4583.jpg" border="0" alt="blk wngd kt 140511 kbni"></a>

Now that's my favourite "urban" raptor, so we too ogled it for a while and then we moved on.

As we prepared to join the JLR (Kabini River Lodge) safari in the evening, we first heard, and then caught sight of, this

COPPERSMITH BARBET:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4591.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4591.jpg" border="0" alt="cs brbt 140511 kbni"></a>

It might be a very common bird, but it certainly is very beautiful!

In the gardens, several

HOUSE SPARROWS 

reassured us that sparrows are, indeed, back amongst us. Here's a male, helping with nesting material:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4592.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4592.jpg" border="0" alt="ml sprw 140511 kbni"></a>

Here's a female, ready to fly off to her nest under the eaves:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4594.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4594.jpg" border="0" alt="fml sprw 140511 kbni"></a>


The next morning's safari started, for us, just outside the JLR gates...in the most eventful way. A mother 

BARRED BUTTONQUAIL

and her three babies decided, suddenly, to cross the road just as our jeep went past...we screeched to a halt, and the jeep went right over them. We looked back in horror...and found that since the three babies had "frozen" to the ground at the first sign of a threat, they were fine, and that the mother was still under our jeep, looking for them! Here's one of them....just look at that little clump of feathers and that eye...have you even seen anything more defenceless?

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4608.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4608.jpg" border="0" alt="bby quail eye 140511 kbni"></a>


We had to stop three more jeeps coming out on to the road, and everyone was wondering what the fuss was about! Sometimes tiny problems can be large one...

Here's another one...would you believe that this little scrap is actually a living creature?


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4609.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4609.jpg" border="0" alt="bby ql scrp 140511 kbni"></a>

Prasanna, our naturalist from JLR, scooped them up carefully on a small piece of paper and deposited them carefully at the side on the road, where they quickly clambered off into the foliage. The mother followed...and heaving a sigh of relief, we carried on, too. These birds...did make us quail for a while!

On the path, every safari, we saw this beautiful

BLUE-BEARDED BEE-EATER

on the tree:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4610.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4610.jpg" border="0" alt="bbbetr profile 150511 kbni"></a>

and here, the beard is showing:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4615.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4615.jpg" border="0" alt="blue beard b-etr 150511"></a>

I have never before seen so many peacocks dancing...and two at a time, too! Far ahead on the jungle path, were these two dancers, practising for some unknown female, but certainly enchanting us.

First they both faced the other way:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4704.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4704.jpg" border="0" alt="pcks back view kbni 140511"></a>


and then one faced us:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4701.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4701.jpg" border="0" alt="pcks one back vw kbni 140511"></a>



Here's the beauty of one of them, who came closer and started preening himself:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4721.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4721.jpg" border="0" alt="pcck tail 150511 kbni"></a>

The peacock flew up to the tree-stump too close for my lens focal length, so I had to use a diagonal shot to get his full flauntiness!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4735.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4735.jpg" border="0" alt="fll pcck 150511 kbni"></a>

The next morning, we took a boat safari on the backwaters of the Kabini, and saw a multitude of birds, including these

OPENBILL STORKS:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4865.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4865.jpg" border="0" alt="opnbl stks 150511 kbni"></a>

some

PURPLE HERONS:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4900-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4900-1.jpg" border="0" alt="prpl hrn 150511 kbni"></a>

some

ASHY WOODSWALLOWS

swooped and landed, reminding me of the many I'd seen in Thattekkad, in Kerala:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4916.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4916.jpg" border="0" alt="a wdswlw kbi 150511"></a>

On the banks, another unusual sight was several

GREY JUNGLEFOWL,

all together; I've always seen only one at a time, before this.

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4924.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4924.jpg" border="0" alt="gy jngl fl kbni 150511"></a>

On the water were the fishermen, sorry, fisherbirds, that included this

GREATER CORMORANT:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4934.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4934.jpg" border="0" alt="gt crmnt 150511 kbn"></a>



it was lovely to watch the

PAINTED STORKS

fish...they hold their wings up over the water so that the fish cannot see the sharp beak of death shooting through the air, lethally!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4941.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4941.jpg" border="0" alt="pntd stk 150511 kbn"></a>

Another able angler is the 

ORIENTAL DARTER, 

which is also called the 

SNAKE-BIRD

because of the shape of its neck, suited to gulping down wriggly eels!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5017.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5017.jpg" border="0" alt="darter 150511 kbni"></a>

Of course another fisher is the

WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER

shown here in successful pursuit of breakfast!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5030.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5030.jpg" border="0" alt="kf wt fsh 150511"></a>

a

GREAT EGRET

waded about, in similar pursuit:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5053-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5053-1.jpg" border="0" alt="gt egrt 150511 kbni"></a>


and a beautiful

SPOT-BILLED DUCK

was waiting for his turn...

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5065.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5065.jpg" border="0" alt="spt bld dk kbn 150511"></a>

talking about turns, here is a

RIVER TERN...


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5133.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5133.jpg" border="0" alt="rvr trn 150511 kb"></a>


a mother

LONG-TAILED SHRIKE

 brought "six-legged breakfast" for that very demanding young one next to her, and then went on repeated sorties for more food:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5203-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5203-1.jpg" border="0" alt="ltshrke 150511 kbn"></a>


We were prevented from bemoaning the lack of raptors because this

CRESTED SERPENT EAGLE

appeared to pose:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5225.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5225.jpg" border="0" alt="cse 150511 kbn"></a>

Late in the evening, on a "This property belongs to R Raman" board (the "this" is visible!)...an 

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN

couple sat:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5258.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5258.jpg" border="0" alt="omr 150511 kbn"></a>



A few final sightings included this beautiful

HOOPOE:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5276.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5276.jpg" border="0" alt="hpoe 150511"></a>

and as we were leaving Water Woods, the extremely expensive resort where we stayed, we watched for a while, and  saw this baby

WHITE-CHEEKED BARBET

snug in its nest, peeping out curiously, and fearlessly!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5248.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5248.jpg" border="0" alt="barbet bby 150511"></a>
