Today, it's the birthday of a very dear friend....but since she's in a very high-powered (and therefore busy) job, we met for coffee on Sunday.

I've never before seen a thorn flanked by two roses :)

We decided that she'd cut pizza as well as cake!

But before we did that, I caught the sinking sun...
