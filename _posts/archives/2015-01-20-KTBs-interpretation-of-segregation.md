A has been talking to Kavya about Martin Luther King and the problem of racial discrimination.

She made this post on FB yesterday:

"We asked Kavya what she was so busy doing after she came home, and she explained that she segregated the pieces of this game board to demonstrate what life was like before Martin Luther King Junior. Yep, it sure seems exactly this arbitrary in retrospect."

I am glad my grand-daughter can think for herself.
