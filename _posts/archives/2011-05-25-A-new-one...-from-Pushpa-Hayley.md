Hi,I just came back from oversea trip to Scotland.I am Miss.Pushpa.A.Hayley,I work with Avocet Mining PLC in UK as assistant senior supervisor.We may not know ourselves for now but it is my heart desire to take vacation leave from our company to visit India for the first time because my  father originally came from New Delhi in  India and my mother from Indonesia.It is no longer a news that Asia is developing so fast and catching up with developed countries with a lot of tourist attraction  centers,it gives me so much joy because I want to witness it and be part of it.

I do not mean to inconvenience you,I want to build a close relationship with you.I will appreciate it if you can spare your little  time to welcome and accompany me,never mind I will take care of the expenses.If you are interested   please  let me know the nearest airport to you that will be easier for you to come and fetch me on arrival?
I await for your reply
My Regards
Miss.A .Hayley
