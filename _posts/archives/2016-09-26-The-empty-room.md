How the monsoon breeze blows
Into this empty room!
Bereft of the person,
It's just memories that blow
Into my mind.
The laughter, the tears, the hopes, the love...
The past echoes 
In this cleared, and cleaned room
As it awaits another shell
To be brought in, and then sent
On its way to rejoin the elements...
The soul has already merged into eternity.
