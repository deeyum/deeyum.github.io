Kalyan Mohan Shaffer made his appearance at 12.42 am on the 28th of January, 2013. MY parents, and grandparents, belonged to the same century as I did...but my grandchildren truly belong to a new Millenium!

How much will I have in common with them? And how much of a fossil will I turn out to be? I wonder...

I call him Peanut (that's what he looked like in the very first Ultra-sound Scan)...but here he looks more of a coconut!

Here he is, with <lj user="biddli">...

"What are these?" he seems to ask of his fingers...

and I tell him,these, and that blue thing, are your choice of all-day suckers!

and another one (no one can accuse me of minginess with photos...I was only waiting for LJ to open up for me, as it does once in a while!)

I'm jet-lagged, sleepless, and tired...but SO happy!
