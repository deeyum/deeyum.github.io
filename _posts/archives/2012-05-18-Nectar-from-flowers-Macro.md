Yesterday, at Lewis Park, I was walking around, and thought I saw some mosquitoes....

but that didn't seem to be what they were, because they weren't about to bite me, but were avidly attacking the tiny flowers nearby:

They had a strange "jumping-up-and-down" action while sipping the nectar, which I tried to catch on video:

Can anyone tell me what these insects are? They are like very large mosquitoes....about wasp-sized.
