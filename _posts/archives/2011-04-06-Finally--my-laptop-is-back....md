...But I am still stuck with some pics on my iPad, some on the HP tablet, and some on this one...collating all of it is going to take a while, and I hope I have the patience to Get A Round Tuit!


But meanwhile, just to get you going, here's Alu Motor, which we found on the menu at Hotel Seema in Jorhat:

And every other shop/establishment in Jorhat seemed to be called Seema..it must be a favourite name there, there was no "seema" (limit) to the number of Seemas we saw!
