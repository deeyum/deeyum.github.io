From the LJ Of <LJ user="friedmomos">

Two laws of existence are:

* Bread always lands in the jam+butter side..
* Cat always lands on its feet.

Use the above two. Tie those so that the butter side and the cat's feet are facing opposite directions. Now drop them. You now have a perpetual machine with ever increasing frequency. ( Visualize them rotating :-) 


I am still laughing....!
