I have stopped taking MLC2 out with me on my morning walk these days....it's summer, and I have to leave really early to get back before the temperature rises to uncomfortable levels, and I don't feel all that safe to be carting it around. But a few days ago, I did, and here are some random things that I caught...


A lovely Cardinal that needs the wind to move:

I took up a challenge that I have to prove...

I said I'd link up these pictures with verse..no matter if my readers see red, and curse!

A series of things that I saw on my walk...


If only this face on the tree could talk!

Webs that look like those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_spider"> social spider </a>:

A wall that should have been a little taller, or wider:

A man who does not rate himself too much:

With this, I say, "<LJ user="beast_666">, cheers!"
