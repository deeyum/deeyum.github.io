In response to our protests against

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/705808.html"> the promotional offer </a>

by Club Mahindra homestay at Castle Bera, Mahindras and Castle Bera have removed the offer from their website.

We, too, had confused the feedback we had got on a blog, from a resort called "Leopard's Lair" (also in Bera, Rajasthan), and we must accept that Castle Bera does not (to use a terrible pun) resort to leaving of bait for leopards, to provide thrills to the tourists.

However, our point still stands...a promotional offer like this usually results in other resorts trying to match it, and then indulging in such practices to ensure big cat sightings. 

So we do have to remain alert. I am now trying to get the details of "Leopard's Lair" to write to them about their bad practices.
