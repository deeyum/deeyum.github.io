Yesterday, I went for a drive with my close friends, and remarked that it had been a long time since we had done a "singing" drive....they pick me up, the entire family of parents and 3 children, and we go for a long drive during which we all sing....and Jayesh said, why don't you sing now? So I sang one of his favourites, "Aap ki nazrOn nE samjhA".

I came back home, and late at night, was rooting around my LJ entries trying to find something else I had written....and found this. Look at the date...what a coincidence!

Close friends picked up, packed me in their Tavera... a family of 5 who included me in their evening drive through the pouring rain, while we individually and together, sang favourite songs....rain is wonderful...IF you have a nice warm place to shelter in, your livelihood doesn't depend on the weather, and you are assured that you will have a hot meal when you feel hungry....how lucky we are.
