Today is the birthday of my only child....and though, 99% of the time, I am happy that she is happy where she is, today I had a little thought sneak into my head...if she were,like the daughters of many other friends, somewhere nearby...!

Oh well.

I can still see her, warm and red, making her first cries (rather feeble; she HAS picked up volume since then!)...I see the infant, angry that she is going backwards; see the little girl going to school, the teenager thinking about boys, the young girl going far away to study, and growing up there...Why should I feel bad about her being far away, there are SO many of her right here in my heart.


Happy birthday, my dearest daughter. Be happy..and be serene.
