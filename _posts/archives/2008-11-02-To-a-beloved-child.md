Though you're halfway around the world,
Where your life and love unfurled...
Though I think of you each day,
Today's a day to specially say....

It's the last few minutes of the date of your birth here, but for you it's still afternoon, and the sun is shining....think of all the great things you are blessed with, and have a happy time!
