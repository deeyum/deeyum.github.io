Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, goes the saying.

But some things are so beautiful that their beauty is universally accepted. Flowers, for example. They don't have to do anything but exist...and that, too, for a brief period of time, before fading away into memories tucked into our brains, or stored somewhere in the cloud.

This flower has definitely faded by now. I snapped it at Galibore, on the 25th of September. But it lives, forever, here: the sunlight shining through it, make it appear as it were aglow with an inner light.

I think memories, photography, and historical accounts are the only way we have of freezing the fleeting, evanescent moments of time.
