....

Made friends with <lj user="prashanthks"> over LJ and then decided to meet him face-to-face and did so; now it turns out that his mother and I knew each other when we were young!

NOW I wish I had gone with <lj user="amogavarsha"> to Prashanth's wedding reception, which was held a few hundred yards from where I live....I would have found an old friend!

They say that there are no strangers, only friends you haven't met yet. In this case, the stranger was a friend whom I *had* met before....

LJ...another thank-you to you!
