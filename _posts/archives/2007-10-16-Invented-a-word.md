...after the last post, I invented a word.Remember you saw it here first.

Ignoscenti, n.(pl.) those who are ignorant about something and quite happy to be in that state; (opp,  cognoscenti.)

Well, actually, I shouldn't be giving the definition of the word, if I am an ignoscentus...!I should be ignorant of it...
