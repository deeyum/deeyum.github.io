A surreal day......a series of happenings. First, having to repack my bags dumping several things,  at the airport, because they were ONE kg over the correct 50 kg weight. 

Then, the discovery that my flight from Paris to Blr is now on alternate days.. Deepa Murphy then would have, instead of 2 hours at the airport, 26 hours. Arranged departure from STL tomorrow. 

Came to the parking lot with the suitcases, and D had to help someone jump-start his car, which took 20 minutes. 

Then we went for lunch, and the spitnik ate well and played, while the big eater ate too much and barfed all over me, herself, the sofa and the restaurant floor. Resulting mess took 45 min to clean. G

Back home, bathed KTB, had a shower myself,  put the clothes into the washing machine and later in India....and then we had to go to meet some people..some days are quite incredible!
