....


Some words strung together make prose. Some words strung together in an effective way make good prose. Some words strung together with metre and rhyme (sometimes) make verse.

But sometimes....

sometimes, words&nbsp;
 go straight to&nbsp;my heart
 stir up the emotions
and bring them,&nbsp;in saturated salty drops, 
to my eyes. they 
echo in the ears of my&nbsp; mind.
my heart swells, my feelings overflow.
difficult to imagine
that light, or sound, neurons and brain cells
make me feel so intensely.
poetry...a wonderful, mysterious miracle.
more than science, more than religion or philosophy.....
poetry is man's claim to greatness.


Actually...been thinking...so is art..so is music....I suppose, finally, it's the human brain which has the capacity for sublime greatness or utter depravity!
