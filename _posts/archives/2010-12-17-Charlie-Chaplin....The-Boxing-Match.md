<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin"> Charlie Chaplin </a>

is a comedian whose films still have the world laughing, decades after they were made.

After enjoying the hilarious scene, I started realizing just what level of choreography must have gone into filming the sequence.... look at the way even that bell is pulled into the comedy routine in different ways! What a comic genius Chaplin was!


I do love the old silent comedies very much. I am amazed at how fresh they are, even today.
