The window has to be open,
The equipment in place.
There has to be a friendly smile
Upon the person's face.

One has to reach out and touch the mind:
The message is wasted otherwise.
Touching someone else's mind
Is not just reaching their ears or eyes.

Images and sounds shower on us.
Some are forgotten, some remain.
Some drops quench our ideas' growing thirst
Some drops are  wasted rain.
