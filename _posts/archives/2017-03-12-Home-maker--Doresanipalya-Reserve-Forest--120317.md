We saw a White-cheeked Barbet, idle, and free.

It seemed to suddenly twist itself, right towards the tree.

I'd wished to see a woodpecker, and as if granting that wish
It pecked to make a nesting-hole, work that it seemed to relish!

Here's the bird, hard at work, rat-tatting away.

"Go and build your own home!" is what it seemed to say!

Yes, we took its sage advice and homeward went our way,
But the thought of the home-building barbet we carry through the day.
