If you're feeling tired
And you want to park your butt
What do you do if the ground is wet
And all the parks are shut?

You don't look for comfort,
You just want to cut
To the chase and find a seat
That's already marked "Butts"!

So what if you can't sit well,
And it isn't enough for butt and nuts?
You're just glad that at least there is
A seat meant for everyone's butts!
