There's no one to take photographs of The Biddles regularly now....or to take videos....

I survive in one city, generally, by putting out of my mind all that I enjoy in the other. But yesterday, I saw a little baby just about the age of GD, with chubby, dimpled little hands and legs...and missed my GD so intensely for a minute...

So, here she is, on the day I left St.Louis...just LOOK at that expression!

She hasn't still learnt to crawl or to sit up, and on Skype, it's very funny, when her parents sit her up, to see her falling like the doll that she is!
