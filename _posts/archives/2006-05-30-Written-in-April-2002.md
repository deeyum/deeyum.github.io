sitting in front of the keyboard,
overflow of feelings normally contained and stored

trying to type love and longing into cold, clinical keys
no way of writing and getting heart's ease....

no yahoo messenger heart emoticon....
thinking about a daughter long grown up and gone....

whispers in my mind...scenes of a young family, laughter..
a smile on my lips at the memory..and an unbidden tear after.....
