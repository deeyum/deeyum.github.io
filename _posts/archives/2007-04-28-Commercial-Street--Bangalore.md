Would you like to share the sights of the Commercial Street area ( an old shopping area of Bangalore, long before malls came in!) in my city?

Well, then, you must first have your blood properly circulated and massaged. What do you mean, your blood is circulating on its own and has been doing so all your life? Nonsense! Here's the machine to do that for you for just two rupees. Just hold those two handles, step on, and there you are!

And now that you are all ready...here you go:

 (the Blood Circulatory Massager makes its appearance again on this post, but just ignore it!)

I like writing for Metroblogs. Instead of enjoying my city by myself, I am able to document its sights and share them with others, too....
