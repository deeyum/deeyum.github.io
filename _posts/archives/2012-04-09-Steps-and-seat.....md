What scenes have these steps seen?
Who are the people who've sat upon that seat?
How many have rested their backs there?
On the steps, how many feet?

How many suns have cast their light
Upon the steps and the seat?
How many misty winter mornings?
How much of summer heat?

How many quarrels or scoldings?
How many newspapers unfurled?
How many people have used seat and steps
To get away for a while from the world?
