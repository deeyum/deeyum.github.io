sAmnE manzil thI..
peechE thI AwAz uskI.

The destination was ahead.
Her voice, behind me.

ruktE thO safar chhoot jAtA.
chaltE thO ussE bichad jAthE.

If I stopped, my journey would break.
If I continued, I'd be parted from her.

manzil ki bhI hasrat thI
aur ussE mohabbat bhI.

I wished to reach my destination,
but I loved her, too.

Ey dil, yE bathA mujhkO...
uss waqt mein kahAn jAtha?

O, my hear, tell me,
Where could I have gone then?

muddat kA safar bhI thA...
aur barsOn kI chAhat bhI thI.

It was a long-pending journey...
And it was a long-standing love.

rukthE thO bikhar jAthE,
chaltE thO dil toot jAthE.

If I stopped, my concentration would be scattered.
If I went on, my heart would break.

yUn samajh lO, ki
lagI pyA gazab kI thI..
aur pAnI mein bhI zeher thA.

Take it that I had a raging thirst,
And the water was poisoned.

pIthE...thO mar jAthE.
aur na pIthE thO bhI mar jAthE....

If I drank, I'd die.
If I did not drink, I'd die...

Thanks to Santosh Oak for this gem.
