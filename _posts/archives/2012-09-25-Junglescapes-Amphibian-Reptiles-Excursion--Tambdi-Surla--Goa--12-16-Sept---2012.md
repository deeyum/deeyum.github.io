The first Junglecapes non-profit wildlife excursion. <lj user="idahoswede"> PLEASE SKIP THIS POST.


Girish, Parimala, Santosh and I visited the Canopy Goa resort for
their Amphibian/Reptilan excursions package. Everything was organized
by Ramesh, who, however, had to drop out at the last minute. It was a
memorable trip. I have put up photos on my Facebook albums, and here
is the creatures list that we have compiled.

<lj-cut text="more about the excursions at Nature&#39;s Nest">

I strongly recommend Ramesh Zermakar and Omkar Dharwadkar...their
knowledge is very impressive, and they are very helpful. Ramesh and
Pankaj Lad (along with his brother Gowreesh Lad) run the resort
extremely well. Even our Innova driver, Ali, was very helpful showing
us Monitor Lizards on the side of the road as he was driving, and
showing us pictures of a python that had eaten a macaque and later
regurgitated it.

Er, no, we did not have any Feni. We were drunk on the beauty of the
monsoon, and the wonderful beings that we could see and observe.
