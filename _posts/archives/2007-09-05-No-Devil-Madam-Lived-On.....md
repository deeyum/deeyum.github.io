OK, OK, that was a very, very feeble attempt at making a palindrome, but I thoroughly enjoyed these equally idiotic palindromes on this video that I found on <lj user="siniak_castle">'s post today!

Not as good as "A Man, A Plan, A Canal - Panama", but very nice to make it into a nice harmonica-accompanied song like that! And note..those palindrome rhyme! that's quite difficult to do...

Thank you, <lj user="siniak_castle">!


....And why is the word for palindrome not a palindrome itself?
