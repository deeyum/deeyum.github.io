I almost NEVER remember people's birthdays in time on LJ...but today I did!!!!

It's already the 17th here, though it won't be, in Western Massachusetts for a while...here's wishing a VERY dear friend (imagine, I have never seen her face-to-face!), a wonderful human being...

I don't know how to do all those LARGE fonts like <LJ user="premkudva"> does, but I would LIKE to use them to wish someone who truly lives through all her senses, has a lively sense of fantasy, and writes so well....who also deals with adversity with wisdom and wit!
