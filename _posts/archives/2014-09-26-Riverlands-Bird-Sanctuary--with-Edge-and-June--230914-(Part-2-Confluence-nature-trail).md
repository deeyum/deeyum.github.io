When we finished at the dam, and had our coffee (thankfully, they didn't say it tasted odd!) Edge suggested we go to the Confluence Point.

We had lunch (I completely forgot to take a photo of it...phulka/veg wraps, and soft drinks to go with it) Here are Edge and June with the coffee, instead!

Here they after lunch, just before starting on the trail.

We started on the trail; the time of day, possibly, was not the best for birding, and we didn't see any. But that bothered me not at all, as both Edge and June are so knowledgeable about everything else I saw, and I got such a lot of information!

<lj-cut text="more about the non-birding part of the outing">

The beginning of the trail had a lot of information:

The pioneers of the westward expansion:

So too did the end point, where the two rivers meet:

Imagine the water being that high!

Butterflies:

I watched a lot of Monarch butterflies. They weren't migrating in clouds, like the nature documentaries showed; there was one, here and there, flying around...

Here are  a couple of un id butterflies:

Wildflowers:

Several  delighted me..

This plant belongs to the Nightshade family:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15341881421" title="IMG_1927 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2942/15341881421_060444e081_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1927"></a>

We found this plant had a strange aroma, but June couldn't place the name.

This is Bindweed, considered a pest in gardens:

Autumn is coming, and the plants let us know:

Here's a burr that inspired Velcro:

This is Illinois Bundleweed, in its dry form.

Here's the fresh variety:

And the leaves:

Insects:

June pointed out these larvae, which were eating the plants around:

Several very large grasshoppers had me hopping after them!

Can you spot the damselfly?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15158235190" title="IMG_1872 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3888/15158235190_9cdba59429_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1872"></a>

Well, I managed to get a close-up:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15158614577" title="IMG_1954 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3855/15158614577_71b4b0b5b5_z.jpg" width="640" height="409" alt="IMG_1954"></a>

Several beetles zipped along our path:

This fat spider swung in the sunshine:

and this little jewel closer to the ground:

Tent caterpillars are considered pests, but that doesn't take away the marvel of their engineering!

I got a Hornet on a wildflower:

And, later, on a bench:

Here's a ground beetle on the Goldenrod:

We discussed centipedes and whether they were poisonous:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15344837982" title="IMG_1942 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2944/15344837982_9792721f73_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1942"></a>

A Harvestman (Daddy Long Legs...just LOOK at those legs!) was a treat to see.

So was a Cranefly.

Amphibians:

This beautiful toad was not easy to see.

It took a lot of effort to take a pic where the creature is not melding into the surrounding leaf litter!

Edge caught one so I could get him (or her):

Then I managed to get it on the path:

The scenery:


The  weather and the open countryside were both beautiful.
