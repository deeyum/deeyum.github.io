On the way back from the Lake of the Ozarks, we had a brief halt at 

<a href="http://www.jeffcitymo.org/main/historyheritage.html">Jefferson City </a> 


 which is the capital of Missouri:

It's interesting that Jefferson City holds the distinction of having been created specifically to serve as the state capital by a commission appointed by the Missouri state legislature in 1821.

We saw several heritage public buildings, such as the State Capitol:

And this lovely building right opposite it:

We walked towards the Governor's Mansion through a lovely park:

Here's the close up of the fancy Governor's Mansion:

And one of the rubberneck taking the photographs, right outside the gate:

What a lovely sight, on Memorial Day, to see the Stars and Strips lit up, not by the lamp to which it was tied, but by the evening sun!

I even got in a bit of bird-watching..it was lovely to see this Housefinch on one the columns of the Capitol, this one's really a "high-up" bird!

We walked to the railroad tracks, with another historic building there:
