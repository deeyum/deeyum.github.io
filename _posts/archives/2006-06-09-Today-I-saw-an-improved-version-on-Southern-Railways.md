Today I travelled back to Bangalore from Chennai on a new coach, and there have been many improvements. Seats are much better designed and that major no-no, stiff metal arm rests, have been changed to foldable armrests....a very big design improvment Today the seat next to me was empty and I could curl up and go to sleep, which I never could before in the days of armrests from hell. Obviously, the windows are all clean still. Alas, seat numbers are STILL on the top of the seat backs, and the TERRIBLE design of the toilets is still there(in THIS DAY AND AGE,we still have toilets that open directly on to the track, and if dirty matter falls on the track at point A, the flush water falls somewhere else, at point B, as the train travels) but the toilet certainly looks neater in design.

And most important, I did see a luggage car as I walked to my compartment. I do wish the day comes when every day train has this facility.

Good that the Railways are improving the coach design. How to ensure that I get to travel in these new coaches every time?
