<lj user="shortindiangirl"> has been undergoing a harrowing time with the Israeli consultate...two and a half weeks after applying for a visa, she is yet to get either her passport back or a visa...imagine, the Israeli consulate in Chicago answers calls only betwen 1pm and 3 pm! They kept asking her for documents which, over the phone, they said they could do without. She stands to lose a large sum of money if she doesn't get her visa in time. Add to this the fact that an Israeli visa stamp on one's passport means that one can never enter any Gulf country again...Here's someone who has managed to upstage our Indian consulate babudom!
