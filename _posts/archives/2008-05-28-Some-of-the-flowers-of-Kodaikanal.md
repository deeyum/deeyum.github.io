I know it is summer because the electricity (and, therefore, the net connection) keeps coming and going....!


Here are a couple of unidentified flowers that I snapped in Kodai, which has a great profusion of both wildflowers and ornamental ones...

and this very pretty one....

Though these are common wildflowers, I liked the backlight:

Lilies bloom all over Kodaikanal Lake:

For other flower pictures, click on any of these photos and they will take you to the Flickr id where I have uploaded other flower pictures....That's the trouble with not having a net connection; the photos pile up and become too many to post about!
