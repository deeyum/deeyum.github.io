A mighty mountain....Darjeeling has a lovely view of the Himalayas, and I have been incredibly lucky, in 1976, to actually see Mt Everest from Tiger Hill in Darjeeling. Apparently, nowadays, a sighting is a great rarity, and guidebooks no longer even mention Mt Everest from Darjeeling. In fact, I had to browse the net a long time to be sure that, for decades, I had not mistaken Kanchenjunga for Everest! But no, I *had* been lucky....
