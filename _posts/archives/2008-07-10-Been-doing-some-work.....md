I conducted my first two "celebrity" interviews....first, <a href="http://www.whereincity.com/movies/bollywood/actress/1097"> Lillette Dubey </a> and then, yesterday evening, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girish_Karnad"> Girish Karnad </a>.

Both of them are very articulate people, and having organized my questions well, I got quite a lot of info about them, for two articles....one, I thought would be a kind of "reminder" post for Metblogs, as I had put in an announcement of Karnad's new play, "The Wedding Album" (ha, that's not on the Net yet; when I googled the words, <a href="http://www.weddingalbumsandmore.com/"> this </a> is all I got!), which is being staged in Bangalore today and tomorrow.

But then, I decided that the article merited an appearance in a more "serious" forum, and today, Citizen Matters is running it as a curtain raiser, and I have provided a link to it on Metblogs,


<a href="http://bangalore.metblogs.com/2008/07/10/go-and-watch-wedding-albums/"> here </a>

It contains the link to the Citizen Matters article, too...only, for some reason, CM has used the word "screening" and not "staging" for a play!

I'll be going to see the play tomorrow....and I think I am going to enjoy it!


A more broad-based (don't ask, "which broad?") article, dealing with their thoughts on Bangalore and theatre in Bangalore, is in the process of being written...and will appear in Citizen Matters, too.
