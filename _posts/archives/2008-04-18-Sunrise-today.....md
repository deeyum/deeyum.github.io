The sun rises on a fresh, new day, and one feels that one can leave old fears behind and indulge in fresh hopes...

The fresh hopes being, that the plumber who has been playing hide-and-seek will finally arrive and address that bathroom leak (update...he did arrive with minions at 10am, and promptly disappeared,promising to start work in "half an hour"...and will not be making a return appearance today.)

Or that the friend who will rectify (ot at least diagnose the problem of) my internet connection, will be able to make it today, his weekly off-day....will give an update on that later.

The clouds ,which veiled the sun this morning, dispersed, and it's another fairly hot summer's day.
