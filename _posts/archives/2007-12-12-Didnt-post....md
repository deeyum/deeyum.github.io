Just now I told someone, "I haven't posted anything today evening..." so decided to!

Here's another huge wasps' nest that I saw near Century Club, Cubbon Park, Blr, on Sunday...

The typical crescent-shaped patterns can be seen. Compare with my photo of a similar nest in Lalbagh...

What beauties Nature shows us! My quizgroup was amazed to know that it was a wasps' nest, some of them thought it was a bird's nest, it was that large!
