Happiness doesn't require an i-Pod or video games...as usual, there is one little boy, who is either tagging along, or whose parents have asked these youngsters to mind him; he is not included in the group, but looks on from the periphery.

Lovely...childhood is full of small joys! The lady's face if full of happiness, too, as she processes the vegetables for the evening meal....
