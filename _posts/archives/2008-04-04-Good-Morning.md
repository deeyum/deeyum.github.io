The view from my balcony this morning:

Feel at peace with the world, and I do hope everyone feels as happy as I do...I think I must be such a boring person, because I don't have stuff-of-a-classic-novel kind of ups and downs in my life! But I like my life exactly the way it is. 

I don't think I want to be more rich, more famous, more beautiful; perhaps less hot-tempered, less immature, less of some other bad qualities that, unlike <LJ user="kshah">, I am not mentioning :)


Two lines from an old Raj Kapoor movie run through my mind; I can even hear Mukesh's voice:

"shyAm kA sooraj bindiyA bankar sAgar mein khO jAyE
subAh savErEy wOhee sooraj AshA lEkar AyE"

(The evening sun becomes a glowing spot and is lost in the ocean;
In the morning the same sun comes, bearing fresh hope"
