One of the things that interest me very much is the wonderful colours of the buses that ply on our roads....the mofussil (sub-urban) buses, and those that connect the various towns of our State. 

I had a bonanza when, on our way back from

after seeing the rehabilitated elephants, we came to the Shivamogga bus terminus.

There were a whole row of colourful beauties. I won't say anything more, but let the colours, the images and the words talk for themselves!
