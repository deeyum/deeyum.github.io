Obviously, I've been musing on this phenomenon of terrorism. War, in itself, is a form of terrorism; it's always the innocent pawns who get slaughtered while the King and Queen look on from their safe fastnesses.

It's interesting that we use the term "barbarism" to describe terrorists; the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian">Barbarian </a>

 according to the Wiki entry, is "a person who is perceived to be uncivilized." but may also mean "an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, insensitive person."

 "Romans used the word "barbarian" for many people, such as the Berbers, Germanics, Celts, Carthaginians, Iberians, Thracians and Parthians."

I thought the word derived from the Berber people, but apparently not.

Well...whatever it is..we thought we'd plumbed the depths of human cruelty when terrorists thought up a plan to send passenger aircraft hurtling into buildings. But to attack a school and kill children there brings our inhumanity to a new low.

One friend incredulously exclaimed:"No one can, atleast in full conscience (I feel), be so brutal and remorseless!"

Oh...but they can.

Several years ago, A was on a flight, and next to her was a woman soldier who told her she was returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan. The conversation was desultory (A did not want to pry into what was obviously an unpleasant experience the woman had had)...when the child in the seat across the aisle started crying.

The woman soldier immediately turned her head away and just shut her ears. And, later, explained why.

In Afghanistan, American soldiers would smile at a child that was wandering from the Afghan tents into their space,hoping to offer them sweets...and knowing this, the Afghans strapped explosives to the child's body, and sent them to the American camps....where, at the moment when the most Americans could be killed or maimed, they would detonate the charge remotely....

One of the reasons the woman soldier was returning was that she could not any longer bear to see such scenes; she was returning for counselling for her deep disturbance. She said, "I cannot bear to LOOK at a child any more. I see only death and destruction and enemity when I see one."

It stands to reason that the children were Afghan ones....so yes, humanity can be incredibly inhuman.
