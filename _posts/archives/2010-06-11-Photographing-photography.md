I enjoy documenting other photographers doing their stuff....


This is Casey, down amongst the flowers at the Shaw Nature Reserve:

and this is what he was photographing:

<lj-cut text="a few more images">

Malvika has named that flower "Jester of the Prairie" for the jester-cap shape of that beautiful flower! If anyone could help me with the correct id, I'd be full of grate...



Malvika was photographing the wonderful bark of what Casey id'd as the 

SHAGGY OAK:

At Forest Park, I got this young man photographing this doll!

at home, this young mother was documenting her baby:

I'm so glad that photography has become easy and popular now....
