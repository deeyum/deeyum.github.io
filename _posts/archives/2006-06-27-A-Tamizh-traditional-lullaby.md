Arirendum kAveri.....


this is one of the most beautiful lullabies, with haunting, evocative imagery, that I know.

The background:

Srirangam is a holy temple&nbsp;town&nbsp; situated on an&nbsp;island, in the Kaveri river, in the state of Tamizh NAdu. It contains the temple of Ranganatha Perumal, and close by is the temple of my&nbsp;parents' family deity, Thiruvaanaikkaaval, where the presiding&nbsp;deities are the goddess&nbsp;akhilANdeshwari and&nbsp; the god is jambukeshwarar or jalkhandeshwarar, so named because the lingam is in the water below ground level.&nbsp;The Kaveri runs almost dry now due to&nbsp;her being dammed in Karnataka, but&nbsp;the Kaveri delta, especially the Thanjaavoor&nbsp;district,&nbsp;has traditionally been the home of art and science,of&nbsp; Vedic education, music and&nbsp;other branches of knowledge.&nbsp;

The general meaning of the lullaby:

 The watering eyes of the child are compared to the two streams of the Kaveri which surround the holy town of Srirangam; and the tears are such that it becomes a rushing stream and elephants bathe in it;&nbsp;it fills the pond and horses bathe in it; it fills the lake of the Kumbhakonam temple where the 12-yearly festival of Maamaangam is held; it fills the tank of the Madurai Meenaakshi temple; it waters the fields of turmeric and ginger, wets the mud and the henna shrubs;&nbsp; it fills up the canals that&nbsp;wayfarers wash their feet in&nbsp;....

The child is invited to tell the singer who beat her...which relative it was(er, the parents who are the most likely to swat the child, are not mentioned!)--the maternal aunts or uncles, or the grandmother....and they will be suitably punished....

I used to sing some of it in a soft monotone(not set to any particular Carnatic raagaa)&nbsp;to my own child when she was young and fractious before sleep. Just now, I got some more of the words from Anu Bharat of Irvine, Calif. Will get all the words clarified and then write the&nbsp;line-by-line&nbsp;translation, and no doubt others will be able to improve on it!</P>
