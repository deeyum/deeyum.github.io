The Wildlife Volunteers' Training Program (VTP) is a week-long accreditation program to train volunteers for censuses and other structured  field initiatives in Karantaka. There was one program in the Bandipur range in 2013 (in 4 batches) , and another in the Dandeli range in Feb/March 2014 (in 2 batches). The camp in the Kudremukh range (2 batches) will be conducted at the Bhagavathi Nature Camp, at Kudremukh, Karnataka.

​The Program is at the Bhagavathi Nature Camp, Kudremukh, Karnataka.

It starts on Sunday noon and ends on Saturday around 2 pm, after lunch. The present batches start on the morning of 18th May and 24th May. 

The fees are Rs.5,500 for tent accommodation, and Rs.3,300 for dormitory accommodation.

2. Travel:  What are the travel options to get there?

​a. Kalasa is the nearest place. It is a town about 15 km from the camp. Eco-volunteers can get participants picked up from here.​

 (Deepa's note: 
The KSRTC Volvo Airavat bus from Bangalore to Kalasa on the 17th is full.However, as of now,the Rajahamsa Executive buses to Kalasa, leaving at the same time and arriving in Kalasa at the same time, have seats available.
  
The return bus on the 24th night has seats available, and I have not checked for the outward journey on the 25th or return on the 31st.)

Other options:

b. Take an overnight bus from Bangalore to Karkala (buses to  Kundapur and Dharmasthala pass through Karkala). Karkala is 50 km. away. Take a cab (or a bus if available, which will get you there in time) to Kudremukh.

c. Take an overnight bus from Bangalore to Mangalore, 100 km away. Take a cab (or a bus if available, which will get you there in time) to Kudremukh.

d. Drive down from Bangalore the day prior to the start of the program.

3. What will the weather be like? (For clothing)

​ Warm to hot with some pre-monsoon rains maybe. Bring a raincoat or an umbrella.

4. What are the facilities available at the Nature Camp?  Are there beds in the tents and in the dormitories, or should we bring sleeping bags? 

​4b.​Will food be provided?

​Beds are provided but getting sleeping bags would be good..can be used in the Anti Poaching Camp.

Food would be provided, of course!​

5. Is there electricity? Can we charge our phones and other gadgets?

​Generator would be run during class room sessions…and for some time in the evening.

6. Is there mobile connectivity at the camp? If so, which service providers (BSNL, Vodaphone, Airtel) ?

BSNL mobiles may work near the main gate and a few spots in the camp. Otherwise there is no mobile or internet connectivity. Be prepared for a week away from the world!

7. Are the toilets Western or Indian? Do the tents have attached toilets? Is there any water shortage? 

​Tents have attached toilets..but not sure if they are Indian or western.

8. Will there be hot water available for bathing?

​No. Ordinary water, yes.
