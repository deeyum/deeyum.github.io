I decided to take a close up of a dragonfly:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/20826686580/in/album-72157657983411825/" title="IMG_4432"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5648/20826686580_4a54cb2aca.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_4432"></a>

What complexity there is, in those eyes, and those wing parts, which allow the insect to hover motionless in the air, or zip along at great speed!

Creation, and creatures, are amazing at all scales.
