With not much hope, I clicked on "Friends entries"...and was astounded to see that the pages actually opened up, AND I could post comments! AMAZING! I could see my friends' posts, and comment too! I rushed to comment on a few...and a few is all I could comment on. WHOMP! I suddenly got a blank screen when I tried to comment on <LJ user="birdonthewire">'s entry about his poem on Spark, and I am back to that he Dark Ages...again.

I was feeling thrilled that the repair of the ravages of the recent D-DOS attacks might have removed whatever it was (no one could find out) that was blocking my LJ. But the curtain has descended again...missing all your posts, and posting all by myself on LJ is just NO fun.

HUH.
