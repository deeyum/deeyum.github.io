Here are some I took a couple of days ago in Forest Park...first let's have the decals:

If that's the case, why IS this person going around in a "vehical" that drinks petrol?

I agree so much with this one too:

But I guess what is being referred to is the fat figure of the

not the ascetic, lean, spare Buddha depicted in our Indian sculpture!


Well, some people are quite ingenious about their genius:

And considering that I took this outside the Muny, where musicals are staged all summer, it's appropriate:

But some people are content with just

We were passing by driving when A spotted this, and D kept driving past and I couldn't get a pic...and D finally had to stop awkwardly. He told me that the car behind us was a police car, and I got down to go and take that snap. Meanwhile, the police car radioed to some cops on the beat, who promptly came over, stopped me, and asked me what I was doing! I showed them the photographs, and they apologized and went on their way....

Oh all ye St Louisians, fear not, the police in Forest Park are alert and chasing away all suspicious characters!


OK, Beast, it's your turn now! :) Just go right on...

and don't worry about "what-if" scenarios!
