Dear All,

I would like to get one of the incident happened this weekend to ur notice.

One of my co-brother met with an bike accident and expired on Friday
night.(A BMTC bus came in wrong side and hitted him)

This accident happened around 6.30 PM near whitefield and initially he got
admitted to a hospital called Vydehi near whitefield.
Later it was proposed by Vydehi doctors to take him to either Nimhance or
Manipal.
So we took him to Manipal around 8.00 PM since NIMHANCE is very far and
also by considering traffic at that time. To reach even Manipal it took too
much time, Most of the delay caused because of Heavvy Traffic in airport
road.  As soon as we took him to the Manipal hospital doctors said his
state is very critical and 95 % he is out. Still they said they will do
CT-Scanning and then they can clearly confirm the status.

Then around 10.30 PM they arranged for CT-Scanning (  Too much of delay ).
Soon after the CT-Scanning one of the doctor reported his BRAIN is damaged
, 2 kidney's and small lever also was damaged for which he  needs to be
operated for a head surgery and a stomach surgery, during the operation he
may die also or at any moment he may die. Soon after they took him to ICU
instead of taking him to Operation Theatre. There was around 1 hr delay in
answering us back from this point. They didnt allow any of us to see him
when he was in ICU untill we demanded and shouted on them. When we demanded
and asked them to discharge so that we will take him to NIMHANCE, Then the
answer from them was they will operate immediately but we need to Admit and
pay around 2 lack Rs. Since we didnt had that much of cash and also we
doubted on whether he is still alive or simply these doctors playing a
game..., But still since they demanded around 2 lack rupees for the
operation before they start it, I went ahead to fill up the forms and pay
money immediately with using credit card , But when our uncle had a look at
him in ICU noticed that he is already dead (this was around 11.30 PM). Then
immediately he asked me to not to make any payment. We went to doctor
in-charge and asked(when we shouted) about his status and chances of he
being saved. Doctor infomred that chances are less than 1 percent, then
only we realized that MANIPAL Administration guys playing a game, and
trying to fool us to collect some money in the name of operations to
operate a deadbody !!!

We took it seriously and tried to contact TV9 on the same day but could not
get the contact numbers...,
Since we were strong enough fight back on Manipal Hospital they agreed that
he is dead and asked us to pay Rs. 30,000 to release dead body.

As we know they didnt give any treatment other than doing a CT-Scan and
keeping the deadbody in ICU fr 2 Hrs.. We shouted on them and demanded to
release the deadbody with CT-Scan charges only. Finally we were able to
fight and take the body with out paying any money as they were trying to
cheat us.
Some how we escaped from being paid for dummy operations being planned by
Manipal Doctors. But if it was some other innocent poor people they would
have ended up with paying full money and cheated by MANIPAL.

The whole idea behind my writeup is : we all know MANIPAL is one of the big
and well known Hospital in bangalore. But these people cheat innocent
people by colleting huge money to operate even deadbody!!! and try to fool
as if they are going to save the patient. I request you all to forward this
mail to all your friends and inform every one on how BIG Private Hopspitals
can cheat .. and to Beaware of these..

For more details you can reach me on XXXXX

Will be trying those numbers tomorrow..but somehow, when I see


small lever also was damaged 


or talking about "NIMHANCE" (like enhance or perchance)I begin to doubt the veracity of the contents...or, the message "lacks" (2 lacks?) authenticity...
