Once again, four of us NTP's got together...this time it was Shreeram (who came back home at 11pm the previous night!), Hrishikesh, Tharangini and I....and Shreeram took us to Gulakmale, beyond Valley School, turning off from Kanakapura Road, and taking various lefts and rights that I didn't keep track of.

I got the Gulakmale sign in Kannada through the rear window, only as we were leaving:

One of our first sightings was this beautiful female

KOEL:

The overcast skies meant that photography was an uphill job, and the others, who have (of course) much higher standards than I do, were bemoaning the fact that one could not get good shots. But one need never worry about getting SMS! Here's one of a 

BRAHMINY KITE

with nesting material:

A beautiful

YELLOW-BILLED BABBLER

sat in the Eucalyptus, high above me:

an

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN

sat on the wire and sang beautifully:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7574.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7574.jpg" border="0" alt="o mgp rbn 041210"></a>

Tharangini is very particular that the bird must be photographed only on a natural perch, but a "bird on the wire" photograph doesn't bother me.

However, I got this

LITTLE EGRET

in the fields, with nice greens and browns throwing the white out in contrast:

I found several

PALE-BILLED FLOWERPECKERS

in the eucalyptus trees, and shot straight into the sky:

At a considerable distance, on a large tree, sat a

PAINTED STORK

whose colours were being admired by the crow!

As there were not many reeds, I was not expecting to see these beautiful

WHITE-RUMPED MUNIAS:

ah, but the best bird sighting of the day was something that intrigued us very much before we got closer ...and realized that we were looking at a fallen

PENGUIN!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7545.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_7545.jpg" border="0" alt="penguin 041210"></a>

I saw a small Spectacled Cobra, which had, obviously, come up to escape the damp ground...but it slithered off within seconds, before I could get over my surprise at seeing it.

Will post the other creatures, and plants...got a lovely blue-striped bee to show...!
