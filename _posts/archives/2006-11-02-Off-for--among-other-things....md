...

Off to Delhi to attend a wedding; hopefully, will get in a trip to Sultanpur for some birding....there's going to be a tussle over the camera this time, which KM has never faced before...he is not going to be happy with the fact that this is due to&nbsp; my following <lj user="kalyan">'s advice to me, not to buy a lower-end camera, but to learn to use the excellent camera that is already in the house!

All you LJ-ers, behave yourselves till the weekend is over (or&nbsp;if you are not going to, post about it!)
