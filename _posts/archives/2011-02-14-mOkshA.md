Nirvana (nirvANA) is a word often used in the West, in the sense of "Heaven", but it actually means "release"...release from the cycle of rebirths that human beings are supposed to be in bondage to. Moksha is the shedding of the chains of attachment, of release from the accumulation of karma, that finally frees the soul to become one with the Great Soul, the ParamAtmA....

On the ghats of the Ganga, I found, fittingly, a chain that was lying on the steps, broken...which soul had found moksha?
