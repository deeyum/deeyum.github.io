I have switched off the TV, and wonder if some of those whom I could see, and some whom I couldn't, on that set, wish they could turn the reality off, too....

I am looking forward to <a href="http://kalyan.livejournal.com/244221.html"> this </a>...and to the baitu coffee I will be having before setting off.

Life's normal for me. It's the Thanksgiving weekend elsewhere, and I give thanks for the fact that I have no troubles worth mentioning.


And talking of coffee....

Well, I'm going to drink coffee...and take the bus! It's ridiklus to add one more petrol-guzzling, polluting vehicle to the traffic...
