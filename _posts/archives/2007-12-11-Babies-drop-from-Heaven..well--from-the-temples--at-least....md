Here's the link (thanks, <LJ user="anushsh">) to the front-page article in the Sunday Times of India, that we read (Dec 9th 2007). It's about a temple in Karnataka where they throw (yes)  infants from the top of the temple and catch them in blankets at the bottom, to ensure that the children have good lives...assuming that they survive this practice...the articles says one infant  " slightly missed" blanket and "landed with a light thud"...


Here, read it...there's a photograph, too.
