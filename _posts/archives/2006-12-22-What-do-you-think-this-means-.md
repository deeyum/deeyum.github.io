This question is only meant for readers in India...

I was going around the area near DnA's home (I love to walk around a lot, I get to know the area very well)...and I snapped this photo of two sneakers hanging from a wire,high overhead, in a most inexplicable fashion. I speculated on how they could have got there,and it intrigued me enough to take a photo.

When DS saw it, however, he was very upset..."HOW close to our place did you see this?" he asked. I told him, it was at least 3 km away...and then he told me that it means that drugs are being sold nearby, this is an "advertisement"...I suppose the word "high" applies to the shoes as well as their user!
