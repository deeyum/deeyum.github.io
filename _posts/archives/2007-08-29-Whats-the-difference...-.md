The hotel we stayed at in Kochi had life-size models of elephants sitting all round a central building in their front lawn...and this angle to one of them was too good to miss....

And the post title?

Q. "What's the difference between a post-box and an elephant's backside?"

The answer is usually, "I don't know", and the response to that is,

"I'll never ask you to post a letter for me..."
