Posting on LJ at the usual times has become nearly impossible. I am unable to post, unable to open friends' posts, and if I finally do, I can't comment.

I do want to support LJ (it's been my first..and deeply satisfying...blog)....but how can I if it gets so tough to post? I am not a techie, who can get around technical difficulties...I'm just an ordinary person who writes her thoughts and experiences as they happen to occur.

I really can't wake up at 5 am every morning just to be able to post to LJ..and my posts on WordPress seem to get updated automatically to my FaceBook page, too.

Hm...will try to continue posting here....
