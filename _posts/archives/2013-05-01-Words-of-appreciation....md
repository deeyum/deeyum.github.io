Here's an FB message I got today:

Hi Deepa,
How are you doing? Its been a while that we have had conversation and may take you a while to remember who I am. :)but more so this is a thank you message. I had been to the wildlife conservation seminar organized by the slothbear foundation over the weekend. It was such a wonderful experience listening to some of the who's who of wildlife conservation. But it really made me wonder how did I reach there? I was not even closely related to any of this 6 months ago. It took me back to sometime in November last year when i started photography. While i was keen on visiting forests, i couldn't. Ihad no clue about anything and started shooting birds at hebbal lake close to my house. My first proper birding trip was with you to the valley school and things have changed right since then. I saw birds, met people, lwent to forests and got genuinely interested in nature and ecology and now i see myself wanting to involve myself for the cause of conservation. In short, it was that one trip to valley school that spurred my interest and l ended up at the conservation seminar where i had a wonderful time. More so, its brought out so much interest in me towards nature. I sincerely thank you for that. 
I hope everything else is fine on your end. Take care.
Regards,
