I realize that Namdapha must be a sort of butterly heaven during the season...because I went out of season, I wasn't even looking for any, and yet I just could not resist clicking some of the common ones!

Let's just start with the beautiful HIMALAYAN JESTER:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6540.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6540.jpg" border="0" alt="himalayan jester 231209 deban"></a>

<lj-cut text="Here's a long Hanuman's tail of pics that will be of interest only to butterfly lovers (and I assure you there are NO rare finds in it!)">

the COMMON RING:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0329.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0329.jpg" border="0" alt="common ring dibru 201209"></a>

the COMMON TIT:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0709.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0709.jpg" border="0" alt="common tit deban 231209"></a>

the FLUFFY TIT:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0325.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0325.jpg" border="0" alt="fluffy tit dibru 201209"></a>


an "open" PUFFIN:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6535.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6535.jpg" border="0" alt="puffin open namdapha 231209"></a>

the same butterfly, with its wings closed:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6539.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6539.jpg" border="0" alt="puffin closed nam 231209"></a>

I learnt why the COMMON CASTOR was called so, after seeing them in their hundreds amongst the castor plants (from which castor oil is made)!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6497.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6497.jpg" border="0" alt="castor namdapha 221209"></a>

the INDIAN RED ADMIRAL:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6528.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6528.jpg" border="0" alt="indian red admiral namdapha 231209"></a>

the METALLIC CERULEAN (this one really did have a lovely blue metallic sheen as it flew about, so naturally I could not get a single shot of it with its wings open. Show me a photographer trying to catch a flitting butterfly with a camera, and I will show you a frustrated person.)

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6396.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6396.jpg" border="0" alt="metallic cerulean 231209"></a>

the LIME EMIGRANT:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6405.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6405.jpg" border="0" alt="lime emigrant 231209"></a>


the PURPLE SAPPHIRE (what a lovely and tough name!)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6425.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6425.jpg" border="0" alt="purple sapphire namdapha 221209"></a>

this is another of the Sapphires:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6435.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6435.jpg" border="0" alt="some kind of sapphire namdapha 221209"></a>

this was one of the "easy" (that is, seen earlier, often enough to be remembered!) ones...the WHITE ORANGE-TIP:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6392.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6392.jpg" border="0" alt="white orange-tip namdapha 231209"></a>

I cannot understand why so many butterflies, such light and delicate creatures that live on sunshine and flowers and in utter peace, should be named after ranks in the armed forces. HOW can associate these creatures of light and air with war? But so it it is.

Here is the SERGEANT:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5899.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5899.jpg" border="0" alt="sergeant 231209"></a>

thank goodness, this one is named after PUNCHINELLO, one of the characters of the Harlequin opera:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6238.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6238.jpg" border="0" alt="punchinellow 231209"></a>


sometimes we get back to the flowers, as with this GREY PANSY:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6192.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6192.jpg" border="0" alt="grey pansy namdapha 231209"></a>

and sometimes the description is so true...this is the COMMON WANDERER:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6235.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6235.jpg" border="0" alt="common wanderer namdapha 231209"></a>

but whoever called this one a PEACOCK PANSY has never seen a peacock, even though the "eyes" may have brought the bird to mind:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6544.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6544.jpg" border="0" alt="peacock pansy nam 231209"></a>

it was amazing how, as I walked, the butterflies folded themselves and just became leaves! Here's that self-same Peacock Pansy, with its wings closed...isn't it a dry, sere leaf?


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6227.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6227.jpg" border="0" alt="peacock pansy closed namdapha 231209"></a>


some more flights of fancy inspired some butterflies being called Tigers, as with this CHESTNUT TIGER:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6609.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6609.jpg" border="0" alt="chestnut tiger 231209"></a>


I could not find the id of this one:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6663.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6663.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

here's the COMMON HEDGE BLUE:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6656.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6656.jpg" border="0" alt="common hedge blue 231209"></a>

back to the bird names...and where there is any chocolate in the CHOCOLATE ALBATROSS, I don't know!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6242.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6242.jpg" border="0" alt="chocolate albatross namdapha 231209"></a>


this one's a COMMANDER...

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5888.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5888.jpg" border="0" alt="commander deban 231209"></a>


My guide, Bidyut, said this one might be an ORANGE-AND-BLACK ROYAL but Karthik says it's more likely to be a RED FLASH:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6267.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6267.jpg" border="0" alt="red flash butterfly"></a>


Here it is with the orange colour not showing:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6265.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6265.jpg" border="0" alt="231209 namdapha red flash"></a>

Here's Bidyut picking up the wing of an unfortunate butterfly, which has probably become some bird's lunch:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0542.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0542.jpg" border="0" alt="vidyut picking up b'fly wing namdapha 231209"></a>


This is the GRASS JEWEL, which Bidyut told me was the smallest butterfly in the world!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6549.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6549.jpg" border="0" alt="grass jewel smallest b'fly 231209"></a>


Some of the MOTHS were lovely too; here's some variety of SCOPULA MOTH (thanks for the id, Kiran!) :

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6200.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6200.jpg" border="0" alt="luna moth namdapha 231209"></a>

and a HAWK MOTH:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0703.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0703.jpg" border="0" alt="hawk moth deban 241209"></a>

here's a moth case, after the pupa has matured and flown out:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_0708.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_0708.jpg" border="0" alt="moth case after pupa has gone deban forest guest house 231209"></a>

We were looking at a dead Moth on the path, when Bidyut, our guide, cracked a great bilingual pun. "Look," he cried, " 'mauth' (death in Hindi) has truly come to this Moth!"


and a few un-id DRAGONFLIES:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6225.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6225.jpg" border="0" alt="un id dragonfly 231209"></a>

</lj-cut>


I end with the WHITE STRIPED BARON:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6258.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6258.jpg" border="0" alt="white striped baron"></a>


I am not sure of many of the id's and would appreciate any help or corrections, please! 

I have also decided that instead of hunting high and low for id's, I am just going to call these butterflies "Krishnamurthy", "Subramaniam", "Vahini" and so on!


I can only imagine what it must be like during the butterfly season in this remote corner of India!
