The creatures of Kabini...well, the large ones are what I am talking about here (remember the yellow-thighed tarantula that I photographed in 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/729878.html"> this post </a>

or the Southern Birdwing?

Well, anyway...the larger creatures of Kabini come in an astonishing variety of sizes and shapes, too. I think the one mammal that everyone goes to Kabini to see is the 

ASIAN ELEPHANT:

(not much chance of seeing an African one here, I must add)

<lj-cut text="some of the mammals I managed to photograph">

These majestic animals can be found in herds, especially on the banks of the backwaters:

Here's another magnificient tusker:

Of course, it's several people's ultimate dream to be able to sight a big cat. On the first safari, we got a sighting of an

INDIAN LEOPARD

rather far away in the forest:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4641-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4641-1.jpg" border="0" alt="farwy lpd 140511 kbni"></a>

It stayed there until we saw it again on our way back from the safari, and then slowly moved off:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4824-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4824-2.jpg" border="0" alt="lpd mving off 140511"></a>

Several jeeps were able to get a glimpse of the animal:

More shots of our second leopard sighting, which was far closer, are

One of the animals that acts as a "Early Warning System" of the forest, giving alarm calls at the nearness of any big cat, is the 

HANUMAN LANGUR

...here are two, at a salt lick; you can see one actually licking!

It was great watching this one actually bringing a figure of speech to life..."showing a clean pair of heels" is to run away...and that's exactly what this one is doing!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4659.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4659.jpg" border="0" alt="langur 140511"></a>

Several times, we spotted the

MALABAR GIANT SQUIRREL

in the canopy...can you spot it in this distant shot?

The

SAMBAR

is a variety of deer which has a glandular secretion in its neck:

Here'e another one. a young male showing the antler buds:

The

GAUR

or wild bison, are also seen in both the jungle and the river banks:

Here's a young one, taken as our jeep lurched forward over rough terrain:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4771.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4771.jpg" border="0" alt="juv gr 140511 kbni"></a>

And an adult, reaching up to the leaves to feed:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4779-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4779-1.jpg" border="0" alt="gr fding 140511"></a>




When near the backwaters, it was lovely to watch many animals at once, in such mixed groups:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4800.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4800.jpg" border="0" alt="mixed grp 140511"></a>



A particularly lovely sighting for me, this time, was being able to watch a

SMOOTH-COATED (RIVER) OTTER

at work, catching its breakfast.

Here's the first sight of this streamlined animal:



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5084.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5084.jpg" border="0" alt="otter first 150511"></a>


Off into the water it went:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5109.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5109.jpg" border="0" alt="otter head 150511"></a>

The meal was caught:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5114.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5114.jpg" border="0" alt="otter fish 150511"></a>

And devoured...watch those canines!

This 

WILD BOAR

was one of the several that we were able to see:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5294.jpg" border="0" alt="wld br 150511"></a>


A reptile which we all like to see from a safer distance than all the others, is the

CROCODILE

and here's a large specimen, with a cormorant giving it company:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5161.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5161.jpg" border="0" alt="croc and cormorant 150511"></a>

Of course, I cannot miss out the mammal that also tries to live in these forest areas; here are the people of the Kabini region, who try to make their livelihood and are in constant conflict with the wildlife:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5170.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_5170.jpg" border="0" alt="pple kbni 150511"></a>

</lj-cut>

I'll conclude with the only mammal that goes to considerable effort and expense to go and watch other creatures...the Wildlife Tourist!
