When I went for the monthly bird walk today, I felt that I was not in the US, but in the country of Chile...the temperature was 0 deg C, but the wind chill factor brought it down several degrees below that! However, in spite of frozen fingers, I had a very enjoyable time!

I managed to get two lifers, a 

RUSTY BLACKBIRD

and a Hairy Woodpecker which I could not photograph.

Here is a Wood Duck couple, nesting on a tree at the creek's edge:

You don't believe me when I said it was Chile?
