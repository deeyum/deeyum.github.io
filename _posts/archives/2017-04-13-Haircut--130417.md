Snip, snip, snip, go the scissors and bits of my hair fall (the best kind of hair fall there is.) I relax and close my eyes. Will this end well or will I look like Raggedy Ann? I don't know, but I am content to leave it to fate, and the hairdresser. The lady in the next seat, with her hair in a made-of-dye-cap, smiles at me. Snip,snip,snip...every haircut is a calendar, measuring out the time in the length of my hair. Short hair has been a great thing for me; I learnt how to swim, I didn't have to put up sweaty hair in a perpetual bun....with a light heart, and a lighter head, I walk home. Snip, snip, snip...a half hour more out of my life, but gone in serenity and peace.

What my friend <LJ user="beast666"> had to say:

I love getting a haircut - That feeling of getting that weight off your head, the metronomic rhythmic snip-snipping of the scissors lulling you into a state of mild hypnotic drowsiness, the faint musky fragrance of the talcum powder, the slap-whack-rub scalp massage at the end - all followed by a long hot shower when I get home.
