I decided I'd attend the Lalbagh outing this meeting (though I *was* missing a lovely trip to Maidanahalli that all my friends seemed to be going on! ...and of course, when I arrived at Lalbagh, the mist was still upon the waters of the lake:

Much later, when the mist lifted, I got to see this 

CRAB:

<lj-cut text="a few more images....">


and this

SPOT-BILLED PELICAN

floating lazily on the lake:

It was nice to see the

CORMORANTS 

and the pelican together on the lake:

this

ROSE-RINGED PARAKEET

seemed to enjoy posing for us!

One of the sights that amused all of us was this

THREE-STRIPED PALM SQUIRREL

flat on the trunk of a historic mango tree.

Historic mango tree? Yes.


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0019.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0019.jpg" border="0" alt="old mango tree 090111"></a>

Here's why:

We all saw, and no one was able to identify, this huge flower:

Update: <lj user="88greenthumb"> has identified it for me! It's the Solandra maxima or the 

GOLDEN CHALICE VINE. Thank you!


It was nice to be able to point to first-time birders, this female

ASIAN KOEL, 

sitting on a tree:

Females of other species were also busy calling:

This 

ASHY DRONGO

made a lovely picture on the Ficus Benjamina tree:

MBK and Swamy told me this was not the usual Rock Bees' hive, but the hive of


DESERT BEES:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9994.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9994.jpg" border="0" alt="desert bees lb"></a>

and MBK said probably there had been a fungus attack on one corner.


Someone had brought some 

OSTRICH FEATHERS


from Africa, and MBK gave a lot of information about birds' feathers:

Here are some of the group in the morning:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9995.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9995.jpg" border="0" alt="bngbrds 090111 lb"></a>


And they are, in our newly-coined term, being "MBK-ed"!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0018.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0018.jpg" border="0" alt="being mbk&#39;ed 090111"></a>

This time,  MBK demonstrated how fibres of animal and vegetable origin burn very differently....he used some fibre that one visitor had picked up, and someone's hair, for the demo! 

One can be sure of learning some little-known facts every time one meets MBK...but the info will be given in his inimitable (and sometimes inscrutable) style!

The 

BAUHINIA PURPUREA

has started flowering:

It was a very enjoyable morning, and let me close with the morning light shining through the majestic trees of Lalbagh, one of my favourite spots of Bangalore!
