I thought it must be lovely to rest, with the winds from the field blowing one's way, the sun shining around, and open to the elements:

When the colours are washed out, it's not monotony, but a serene, peaceful monochrome.

But then, I felt that the departed soul might mingle with the Everlasting, and might not identify with just one spot. The memorial is not for those who are gone, but for those in whose memories the departed live..
