I think I have been very fortunate in meeting many people over blogs or email, who subsequently become good friends....today I arranged to meet up with <LJ user="udhay">, whose pursuits have impressed...and intrigued....me.

I felt so comfortable talking to him that I spent considerably longer than I had planned, and some of the writing for the day has been postponed....he spoke of the many things he liked to do, and I was amazed how he found the time for everything!

He is unusual to me in that he first founded his own IT company and then wound it up and moved to a large IT company...it's more usual to hear the reverse. 

Oh...I never got to talking to him about his interest in fragrances, which was what I wrote to him first about! Well, there was a whole lot of other interesting stuff he had to say...he is amazingly knowledgeable about a variety of subjects! He says he has a "packrat" memory..seems a prodigious memory to me..and the recall factor seems excellent,too!

He says he loves to connect with people, and loves to connect people...what a profile for someone who does marketing-oriented work!

Looking forward to meeting more of his friends...
