I often look at, and sometimes post photographs to, the

Being me, I commented on several of the lovely photographs for this week....and after typing in two-two nonsense words at a time, I was soon prevented from commenting at all, and was shown this message:

I really want to slam the idiots who write the messages for Facebook. Commenting on several photographs is "repeatedly misusing" a feature? "Engaging in behaviour"...as if I am doing something anti-social! "Annoying"..."abusive"...has Facebook never heard of courtesy?
