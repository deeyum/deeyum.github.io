I love cryptic crosswords;&nbsp;I adore the Deccan Herald Saturday one, which is very witty; like the DH daily and the IE daily and the Eco Times daily ones; don't like the Hindu one but will do it if there is nothing else. I was told that the cryptic crossword is an essentially "British" pastime...is it, I wonder?

I also love doing this daily (it is one of the few card games that one can play on one's own; I have made cards for dyslexic children as it is a simple game of pattern recognition:

I love lots of other "parlour" games like Cranium, Carcazone, Boggle, Dingbats, Dictionary,&nbsp;and so on, but most of these require others to play with...and I don't have company most of the time...
