Loved the melody of this song, though I canNOT understand this "dark skin is inferior to fair skin" that is implicit in Kamal Hasan's dark shoe-polished face.

Who's the actress? I watch Tamizh movies very rarely, I don't know her name.



<lj-embed id="52"/>


Here's the transliteration of the lyrics and a very rough translation of the meaning:


Kamal:

kaNmaNi...anbOdu.... kAthalan..nAn... anbOdu ezhuthum kadithamEy


Write 'darling'.... then, 'with love, this is the...letter'..no. maybe some other word...ok, you can write 'letter'...

Actress: writes:


kaNmaNi...anbOdu kAthalan..nAn... anbOdu ezhuthum kadithamEy

(Darling, this is the letter that I, your lover, is writing with love)

Kamal:Read it!

A (sings) :  kaNmaNi...anbOdu kAthalan..nAn... anbOdu ezhuthum kadithamEy

K: 
(laughs) pAttAvEy padichutiyA? kaNmaNi shonnen illai...antha edathula ponmaNi pOttukkO...

(oh, you sang it as a song?...where I said "kaNmaNi" (darling)....put "ponmaNi"(dearest) there...)In the place where I said "kaNmaNi" (darling) you can put "ponmaNi" (dearest)..that will suit better....

on veetley soukhyamA? nAn inga soukhyam

(are you fine at home? I am fine here)


A:(sings)

ponmaNi..un veettil soukhyamA..nAn ingu soukhyamEy
 

(dearest, is everything fine at home? here I am fine)


K:


unnai nenacchu pAkkum pOthu manasuley kavithai aruvi mAthiri kottuthu, AnA atha ezhuthaNumnu okkAnthA....ezhutthu thAn...vArthai...


(when I think of you, the thoughts flow like a stream in my mind, but if I want to sit down and  write it...the words....)

A(sings):

unnai eNNi pArkkayil...kavithai kottuthu

(when I think of you...the poetry flows)

K:

athAn

(that's it!)

A (sings):
athai ezhutha ninaikkaiyil vArthai muttuthu...

(when I think of writing it, the words don't come...)


K:

athEythAn! pramAdam! kavithai..padi?

(that's exactly it! Great! the poem...read it?)

A (sings and repeats the song so far):


kaNmaNi...anbudan kAthalan..nAn... anbOdu ezhuthum kadithamEy




A (sings):

unnai eNNi pArkkayil...kavithai kottuthu

athai ezhutha ninaikkaiyil vArthai muttuthu...

OhO...kaNMaNi.......

Alternately, K and A, lA lA lA...


(background music)


K:

mmm...enakku undAna kAyam.... athu.... thAnEy Aridum...

(it's a wound that I got, it will heal by itself)

ennamO theriyalai  enna mAyamO theriyalai... enakku oNNumEy Avarathu illai

(don't know why, nothing happens to me)

itheyum ezhithikke

(write this too)

nadoola mAnEy thEnEy ponmAnEy ithellAm pOttukkaNum...mm?

(in between you have to put in words like  "deer", "honey", "golden deer", etc...ok?)

ithe pAru... enakkenna kAyam nAlum, en odambu thAngidum...

(look here...any wound of mine, my body can bear...)

on odambu thAnguma? thAngAthu! abhirAmi...abhirAmi...

(will your body bear it? it won't! abhirAmi...abhirAmi...)

A:

atheyum ezhuthaNumA?

(is that also to be written?)

K:

m-hm! kAthal! ennOda kAthala nenakkum pOthu azhugaiyA varathu...Ana, ennOda shOgam onna thAkkidumOnnu nenekkum pOthu...vara azhugai kooda ninniduthu (laughs)

(no...love! when I think of my love, I feel like crying..but when I think that my sorrow might affect you, even the tears that come, stop...)

manithar uNarndukoLLa ithu manitha kAthal alla! (echo)

athayum thANdi punithamAnathu (echo)

this is not a human love that humans can understand
this is something sacred beyond it...

A (sings) :

uNdAna kAyam engum thannAle mArippOna mAyam enna...ponmAnEy,ponmAnEy!

(what's the magic by which the wound that was inflicted, healed itself, O golden deer?)

enna kAyam Ana pOthum, en mEni thAngi koLLum...unthan mEni thAngAthu...shenthEnEy!

(any wound that happens, my body can bear, your body can't, honey!)

en kAthal ennavendru... shollAmal Enge Enge...azhugai vanthathu...

(being unable to say what my love is, and yearning, I felt like crying...)

enthan shOgam unnai thAkkum endreNNum pOthu..azhugai nindrathu...

(when I thought that my sorrow might affect you, my tears stopped...)

manithar uNarthu koLLa, ithu manitha kAthal alla

(it's not a human love for humans to sense)

athayum thANdi punitham Anathu..

(it's beyond that, it's sacred...)

K (sings) d:

abhirAmiyE...thAlAttum sAmiyEy nAn thAnEy theriyumA...

(Abhirami.. do you know?.....I am the god who cradles you with a lullaby...)

shivakAmiyEy...shivanil neeyum pAthiyEy...athuvum unakku puriyumA...

(shivakami...you are half of Shiva...can you understand that...)

shh...

shubha lAli lAliyEy, lAli, shubha lAli lAli lAli (hush a bye...)

abhirAmi lAli...shivakAmi lAli...

repeats ...

alternately, K and A sing:

lA lA lA...etc. till end of the song.
