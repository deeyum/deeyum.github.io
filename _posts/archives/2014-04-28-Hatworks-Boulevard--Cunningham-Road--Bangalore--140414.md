Since my friend Uma is shortly to relocate, we decided to meet up and do some gallivanting as well, and almost at random, wound up at

<a href="http://www.hindu.com/pp/2006/08/12/stories/2006081201160200.htm"> Hatworks Boulevard </a>

Here's the bungalow, with a vintage car to go with it (it's a Morris Minor):

Imagine the innocence of the days when that was the height of a surrounding wall!

Here are my friends, in the yard of the beautiful bungalow:

One of the ladies working in a plant shop helped us with the photos:

The windows are old-style; a glass shutter inside and a wooden one outside.

Here's the detail of the building, and the old way of having large trees shading the structure:

The beauty of the "monkey-top", an ornamentation typical of Old Bangalore:

Alas, the only way these bungalows can be maintained, apparently, is by cutting them up into business establishments.

The mosaic tiles were so beautiful:

I could not gauge if this porch ornamentation was recent or old

I found this old mechanical gadget on display:

The beautiful teak cabinet in which it was:

Beauty often resides in the warmth of the smile.

All of us had a great time wandering through the old building, and came back to the present with some yummy street food...a great evening, spent with some great friends.
