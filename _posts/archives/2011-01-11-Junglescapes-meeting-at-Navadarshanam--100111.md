We had the

 committee meeting  at

<a href="http://www.navadarshanam.org/"> Navadarshanam </a>

yesterday and found our way to the venue, with helpful signs posted down the narrow village roads:

Here's the beautifully constructed cottage in which we had our all-day session:

Our meeting was carried on in such pleasant surroundings:

But on our way to and from the cottage for lunch, I quickly caught sight of

several

SANDALWOOD trees:

the colours of the 

BADAM TREE 

leaves against the sky:
