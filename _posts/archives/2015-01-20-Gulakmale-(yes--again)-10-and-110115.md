On the 10th only 3 of us went there, but we did find quite few other birders. We were able to meet and exchange notes.

Kiran, Guru, and Prem....we are ready to start!

The swallows made written music against the sky.

It was a misty, beautiful sunrise:

The lake was equally beautiful as the sun rose.

<lj-cut text="Two pleasant mornings">

We found a fair number of birds, including this

JERDON'S BUSHLARK on a Calatropis (milkweed) bush:

A

LITTLE RINGED PLOVER

ran around, too.

This

WHITE-BROWED BULBUL

posed for me.

One bird that I don't often click is the 

JUNGLE CROW

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16091967560" title="IMG_9211 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8644/16091967560_74c4b07977_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9211"></a>

This palm tree bears many

ASIAN OPENBILLS.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15656922694" title="IMG_9214 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7505/15656922694_8924b5f604_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9214"></a>

Here's their typical foraging behaviour, picking up snails from the shallows:

Here's one in flight.

Everywhere, on the dried-up areas of the lake bed, the Calatropis (milkweed, this one's called the haldi-kumkum plant because of the yellow and red flowers) plants were flowering and dispersing their seeds by the wind:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16091327098" title="IMG_9167 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7481/16091327098_5982ce1e83_z.jpg" width="640" height="436" alt="IMG_9167"></a>

SANDPIPERS

waded along the water's edge.

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIAS foraged, too.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15656453064" title="IMG_9180 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7582/15656453064_95111b29a3_z.jpg" width="640" height="420" alt="IMG_9180"></a>

Here's the beauty of the shallow part of the lake:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16091336088" title="IMG_9182 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8644/16091336088_a27fb461ea_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9182"></a>

And the beauty of the arid mounds with grass:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16091512520" title="IMG_9189 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7555/16091512520_b57c6cdfa6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9189"></a>

It was fun to see birders and birds looking in opposite directions!

I liked this Cat On A Cool Tin Roof!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16277566781" title="IMG_9225 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8643/16277566781_a522ff8cd1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9225"></a>

It was funny to see the cat and the White-browed Wagtail completely ignoring each other!

Peepal leaves made emeralds and a ruby.

This is what our revered and worshipped gods come to, after immersion:

On the 11th, we were a larger group at the MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15661023444" title="IMG_9251 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/15661023444_66d6578ba8_z.jpg" width="640" height="415" alt="IMG_9251"></a>

Some of the sights were not as delightful as others.

A bird in the hand may be worth two in the bush, but these two

TAWNY-BELLIED BABBLERS

were priceless!

RED AVADAVATS (Lal Munias), were in the reeds.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16283449755" title="IMG_9276 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7580/16283449755_535b44bc98_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_9276"></a>

they had the photographers waiting.

BARN SWALLOWS

sat upon sticks and pondered the meaning of life.

A 

SIBERIAN STONECHAT

did so, too!

GREAT CORMORANTS

formed a diving and fishing line.

Butterflies like this

TAWNY COSTER

were around, too.

The grasses looked gorgeous against the light.

We returned via the Champakadhama temple.

I must end with a pic of this ruby-eyed ruby of a Lal Munia male:
