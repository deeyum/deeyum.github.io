DnA suddenly decided that there would be a scientific experiment for the education and edification of KTB, and they chose one that involved baking soda, vinegar, a glass bottle, and a balloon.

D measured out the last of the baking soda:

KTB put it in the glass bottle, which held some vinegar:

The vinegar frothed up:

At this point, D realized that the mouth of the bottle was too wide to fit the balloon around, and the experiment was going to be repeated with a narrower-mouthed bottle:

Many hands were required for this delicate operation,because this was the last of the baking soda:

We watched the end result:

The observer observed.

I think The Booda was recording and documenting all this on his laptop, but I am not sure:

He certainly seemed happy with his efforts, though.

The balloon filled up, satisfyingly but not fully, with carbon di oxide gas:

Now I'd like KTB to realize that all the cooking done in the kitchen, that gets the food on the table,  is also a series of chemical reactions, starting from the setting of her favourite "thayir" (yogurt)!
