Jayanagar, near the Ashoka Pillar, has an avenue (an avenue, by definition, is a tree-lined street), filled with, among other trees, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigelia"> Sausage Trees </a>.

This is the time when the tree bears both flowers and fruits, and incredibly striking they are, too.

Here's a flower and a bud:

Here are some flowers, hanging down on their stalks:

And these are what the fruits look like:

The city planners planted such beautiful trees in the past, today's officials are only thinking of cutting them down for "economic growth" and to ensure more vehicles can stuff up the barren, sterile roads without footpaths or trees....

Is it any wonder that I am participating in a walk that warns against indiscriminate tree-felling?
