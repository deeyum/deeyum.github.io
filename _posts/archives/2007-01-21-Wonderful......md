The bald eagles are just amazing birds....World Bird Sanctuary, Illinois, was where we went to see them.

The Canon developed some trouble (wouldn't you know it) just as we were approaching the riverine habitat, and the pictures....are not going to be great. But being me I will still post some of them...

We were able to see adults and juveniles, we saw them fishing and just sitting on the ice (yes, it was cold enough today that part of the river was frozen over, at least on the surface).

This is the most majestic bird of prey I have ever seen.(Admittedly, I haven't seen TOO many!)

It's very late so I will probably post some pictures tomorrow if I find time...weekends are hectic times in this country...work happens through the week, and life happens at weekends!
