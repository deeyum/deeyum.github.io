Watched "Slumdog Millionaire"...and got to wondering, "how is it that I am born so privileged, and others are not?"


After years of pondering this, I have no answer....I can only thank my good luck.

Meanwhile, here's a TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER singing sweetly at the Valley School this morning (yes, I went *again*!)

Do remember, if you are in India, to watch the Republic Day Parade floats on TV! They make a great spectacle.
