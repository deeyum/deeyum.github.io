Heh, heh, my last few posts have been musings, with no pictures...because some (hopefully) lovely pics of the Serengeti and Mt Kilimanjaro are going to come along soon...wish us a good trip and great sightings please!

But let me include this wonderful misty view of the hill ranges from Nandi Hills...

My friends on LJ...I am sure, that if I don't access it for even a day, you will make the most interesting and amazing posts...oh, well, I will catch up sooner or later.
