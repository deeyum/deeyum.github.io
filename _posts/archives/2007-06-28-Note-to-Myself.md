Before committing my time to someone for some activity, I must have a very clear idea of when that activity will happen, how long I might have to wait for it, what else I might have to miss on that account, and how much of time I might spend, or waste...

Learnt this today. No one can be held responsible, sometimes; these things happen; it is I who must be more careful.

It's a note to myself, but I think it is universally applicable..so leaving it as a public post!
