And really amazing..this "flower" started moving across the leaf and I realized it was an insect!

Madhu says this is a kind of MEALY BUG:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11363665@N07/1161110501/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1038/1161110501_e9a99f09f4_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="&quot;flower&quot; insect...it was only because it was moving that we realized it is an insect!" /></a>

Could someone help me with the id's? Thanks!
