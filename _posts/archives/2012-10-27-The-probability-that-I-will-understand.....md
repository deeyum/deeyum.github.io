I canNOT understand probability theories. I think that everything is just 50-50...either it will happen or occur, or it will not.

On a mailing list that I belong to, someone attempted to explain it to me (as also to children who are facing the concept for the first time). But....

I can TELL myself all this:

 But it ultimately makes as much sense to my intuition as this:
