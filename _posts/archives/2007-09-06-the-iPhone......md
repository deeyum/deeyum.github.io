SAN FRANCISCO -

*Apple Inc.* slashed the price of the top iPhone by $200 Wednesday to
bolster holiday sales, but also angered loyal customers who paid top dollar in the gadget's first 10 weeks on the market.
.........

The 8-gigabyte iPhone will now cost $399 - one-third cheaper than when it
went on sale June 29. The 4-gigabyte iPhone, which sold for $499, will be
phased out. By comparison, the iPod Touch will sell for $299 for the
8-gigabyte model and $399 for the 16-gigabyte one.
