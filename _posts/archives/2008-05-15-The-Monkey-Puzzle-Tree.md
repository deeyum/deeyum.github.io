While we are at Lalbagh for <LJ user="kalyan">'s Digital Photography Workshop field trip, I took this picture of the leaf (if you can call it that) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria_araucana"> Monkey Puzzle Tree </a>.

Lalbagh has some majestic Monkey-Puzzle trees, and the name certainly puzzled THIS monkey, until I went and read the Wiki about it.

Imagine, these trees being brought by Hyder and Tipu's emissaries from South America, and being planted in Lalbagh....what a beautiful scene that evokes in my mind!

In the middle of all their wars with the British, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan yet had time to encourage such horticultural initiatives....
