Born on the twenty-eighth, just twelve days ago,
You'd think his growth would be very slow.
Au contraire. He has been fleet...
He seems already to have grown...two feet!

One socked foot, and one with purple toes...
I couldn't do justice to these in prose.
I had to sing of the legs, toes, and all;
Here's my song about my grandson...two feet tall!
