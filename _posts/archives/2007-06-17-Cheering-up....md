<Lj user="noelladsa"> cheered me up inmmensely just now.

I have been feeling VERY low about the fact of my having bought a Canon S3IS, because I am getting, as I told DnA, only "foozly" pics on it, and am so very unfamiliar with it...

the manual isn't terribly user-friendly (it assumes that I will know several things about digital photography and camera settings that I don't)and after getting a set of blurry, shaky shots, and not bein able to get the flash to work, I was feeling very demotivated.

I wondered if I should have asked KM to get me another Canon SLR body too...then I want to the INW site and there are 3 or 4 people who use the S3Is and they produce superb photographs, so I know *I* am the fly in the ointment...but I wanted to post those shots anyway..


and Noella's comment has immensely cheered me up because now I feel that no
 matter how technically poor my output may be, it's OK, I have hope of improvement...

I guess I need to figure it out a looot more and get inputs from people like <LJ user="sainath"> who have been using an S2 IS for a while and are totally in control of it...

Want to really master this camera before our trip to Serengeti happens....I certainly don't want to take the kind of pictures I have been taking so far....oh well, another long journey of learning ahead!
