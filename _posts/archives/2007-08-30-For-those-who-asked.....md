I should have known that I could not post a pic of a yacht, even in the background of a picture, without getting requests to post photos of it, too! I got one request over LJ and several over email..so for those who want to see the yacht, the "Taj Cinnamon Coast", riding at anchor in all her beauty...here's a pic of the hotel with the yacht, from a distance:

The hotel is NOT that high-rise building on the left that's a public building,which I should remember from all my visits to Kochi...but don't!


(Update. Srikrishna, a friend who reads my blog-but never comments!- says that it is the Kochi Port Trust Building, which of course I should have remembered! Thanks, Sri.)

... the heritage part of the hotel is hidden behind the trees, and the small tower block is to the right, not in the pic at all.


And here's a close up of both the yacht and the powerboat that the hotel uses:

Of course I took a guided tour of the yacht, though we didn't have the time to spend one night on it, as was advertised! We also didn't do this because the rooms at the hotel (well, at least the ones facing the backwaters, I presume) had a very intriguing feature...the bathroom had a blind that could be pushed up, so that whatever it was you were doing in the bathroom, eg soaking in the tub, shaving, or merely reigning on the throne, you had a view of the outside!
 
Here's the view OF the bathroom from the room itself:

And here's the view FROM the bathroom, you can see the tub in the foreground:

and for those who are curious about that elephant backside I had posted earlier, here's the outdoor pavilion with one corner showing a sitting elephant ( a most awkward pose to depict, I thought!)

We did wish we could stay a day more, at least, at this place!
