I have made

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/979344.html"> this post </a>

about taking an infant for a walk in her stroller, and coming upon a raptor with a kill.

Little did I know that history would repeat itself!

It is cloudy and gloomy at Gurgaon, and instead of sitting idly in the 19th floor, apartment, I decided to get some exercise by climbing down, walking around the building, and then climbing back. 

As I walked on the pathway around the building, which is shaded by small tree, I was thrilled to see a Shikra which had just made a pigeon kill!

I dared not go too close.

It looked around for a bit, and then carried the pigeon across the barbed wire fence to the ground of the adjacent apartment building. In the process, it dropped its prey.

However, I was able to click it, waiting for several unheeding people to go past before it dropped down out of my sight, presumably to pick up its food and go off.

That was quite an unexpected bonus of the walk, and I never felt the 19 floors I climbed up, afterwards!
