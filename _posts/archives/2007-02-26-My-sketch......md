I was just posting this sketch of mine on to LJ when I get a call that <LJ user="sainath"> had his first wild-tiger sighting in Dudhwa National Park over the weekend...

And here's my sketch, dedicated to these majestic creatures....

I wish they burn brighter and brighter in the forests of the night!
