LS was a math major in college; after her sons were born and were in school, she decided to study architecture. A few years ago, she took the very tough 9-part licentiate exam and qualified to practice on her own. 

<a href="http://www.lynnshafferarchitect.com/"> here </a>

is her website...Wave House is her own home, designed and built recently. I've visited there a couple of times...it's a warm home, not just an "architect-designed house".

I am proud that my daughter is her daughter-in-law!
