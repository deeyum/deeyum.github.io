Back from a great trip to JLR Old Magazine House, Ganeshgudi, Karnataka...but more about that later. A series of misunderstandings , and a song that my friend Pavitra Jayaraman sent me, set me musing on relationships, and how proper communication is vital...

Here's the original:

And, though I do not like remixes usually, this one is an extremely melodious capella:


<lj-embed id="944"/>

The lyrics, with a rough translation:


Uravugal thodar kathai unarvugal siru kathai

Relationships are serial stories; feelings are short stories

Oru kathai yendrum mudiyalam

A story may end any day

Mudivilum ondru thodaralaam

One might continue at the end of another

Iniyellam sugame

All will be fine now

Un nenjile baaram unakagave naanum

Your heart is heavy....for you, I too

Sumai thaangiyaai thaanguven

Will bear your load like a sumaithaangi (roadside load-bearing stones)

Un kangalin oorum yedarkagavo eeram

Why the moisture at the corners of your eyes?

Kaneerai naan maatruven

I will change those tears

Vedanai theeralam verum pani vilagalam

Pain may cease...the mist might clear

Venmegame puthu azhagile naanum inayalaam

Oh,white cloud....I might meld, too, in the new beauty

Vaazhvenbatho geetham valarkindratho naanam

Life..it is a song...shyness..it grows

Naal ondrilum aanandam

Happiness, any day

Nee kandatho thunbam ini vaazhvellam inbam

What you've seen is suffering...now, all of life  will be blissful

Suga raagame aarambam

A new melody of comfort  begins

Nathiyile puthu punal kadalile kalanthadu

The new reeds in the river have mixed with the sea

Nam sondamo indru inaindathu inbam piranthathu

The relationship between us...it has united, today...bliss has been born
