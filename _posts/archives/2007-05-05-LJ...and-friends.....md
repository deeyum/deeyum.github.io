Went to the wedding reception of <LJ user="sunson">. Took us (<LJ user="amoghavarsha"> and I ) two solid hours to get there. "Cauvery Nagar" is the new name, apparently, of N S Palya (now don't ask me what those letters stand for....this N S Palya is  in R T -Rabindranath Tagore-- Nagar, is so far away, and I also live in another  N S Palya in south Bangalore which is now called J P Nagar --Jaya Prakash Nagar)....with the result that we hunted high and low, traversed through many rival-the-lunar-craters roads, and finally reached  just in time to wish Sunson and his beautiful bride (and colleague at work!) Deepti.. before they left (otherwise we might have had to follow them on their honeymoon)! It was nice to meet <LJ user="vyshnavi"> and <LJ user="ti22">, looking very happy together, and I also met <LJ user="nearfar"> who sends me many interesting links about Buddhism. 

Here's wishing Suraj and Deepti (what a nice combination, Suraj means the sun, and Deepti means the glow, the flame....!)an <strike> amazon'</strike>  amazin' life together..

Because of our hunt-the-address, we missed <LJ user="knutties"> and <LJ user="mewpsych">....I am feeling terrible about that...
