....

I wrote this in an email to <lj user="udhay"> (who, remarkably, never deletes an email and identified me from one I had sent him by mistake in 2000)......


&nbsp;have been very lucky in being able to get along with people more than 20 
years older and more than&nbsp;20 years younger than I am...so to me, age is a state of 
mind. (except when some bones and muscles --or lack of them-- disagree.)
