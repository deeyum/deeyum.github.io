On our visit to the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, several birds thrilled us through the day.

this

TAWNY EAGLE

put in a thrilling appearance, and was mobbed by crows:

<lj-cut text="more birds, and six-footers">

A distant

smiled at us:

It's only when we see the 

BLACK-WINGED STILT

out of the water, that we see how well-named it is!

We listened to the cacaphony of the

JUNGLE BABBLERS:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/10688175666/" title="DSC01595 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2892/10688175666_16defb5f87_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC01595"></a>

(taken at high zoom...the idiot birds were far away from the road and we had to beat a path through heavy scrub and fields...still could not get close.)

We stopped at a roadside pond in Sathanur:

The pond had this

BRONZE-WINGED JACANA:

eyeing a family of

COMMON COOTS

chugging through the water, until, at last, one them got one of the babies.

until finally, we saw one Kite attack, lift a little one successfully, and fly off...

A 

POND HERON

caught a huge fish, and struggled to swallow it:
