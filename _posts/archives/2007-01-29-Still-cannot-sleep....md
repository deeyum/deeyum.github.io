...so, if you haven't yet, do watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth"> "An Inconvenient Truth" </a> , a documentary on global warming, presented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore"> Al Gore. </a> It's a scary documentary, no matter what he says about there being a message of hope.

Gore lacks the charisma of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton"> Clinton, </a>  but he comes across as a man of substance. If I had a vote, I would vote for him rather than the known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton"> Hilary </a> or the unknown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"> Obama...</a>

And if you want to be right royally depressed, read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inheritance_of_Loss"> The Inheritance of Loss </a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiran_Desai"> Kiran Desai, </a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_Prize"> Man Booker Prize </a> winner.

Expecting reactions to this...
