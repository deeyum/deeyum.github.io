This cartoon, which I drew when in college, proved to be so popular that I must have drawn dozens in the notebooks of my friends, teachers, and college mates...decided to draw one and send it as a greeting card to someone today.

I've done a lot of variations of this child..barefoot, only-nappy, no hair, no flowers, and so on.... 

I do love drawing, but don't get around to it too much!
