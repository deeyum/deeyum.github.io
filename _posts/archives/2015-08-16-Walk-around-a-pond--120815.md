<a href=""> Lewis Park </a>

While the children played, I just walked along the edge of the small pond there, and found enough to keep me riveted.f

The founatin

and the Cycling Goldfish

started me off, but I noticed these beautiful dragonflies:

There was also this water beetle (at least, that's what I think it was) which was tough to capture because it would keep zipping to and fro:

A 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_wasp"> solitary hunter wasp </a>

 was looking for a place for its nest, or for prey to stun:

There was death, too, in the pond, where this dragonfly had met a watery end.

Cicadas had left their old selves at the edge of the pond

The very grass was beautiful.

Monarch butterflies were migrating:

Meanwhile, one mammal had decided to get water from the level most suitable...

As the mosquitoes got active, we left the park to the cycling fish.
