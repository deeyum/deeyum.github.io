I often see water tanks on top of houses that are built in the shape of Maruti cars, or even boats...but this one really took the cake.


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14175484@N04/1521545347/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2227/1521545347_4c787fc929_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="the lorry matches the water tank...." /></a>

Obviously, the owner of the house owns that lorry, and wanted to immortalize it as a water-tank on top of his terrace...what a beautiful match!

I just couldn't believe that the lorry was also parked there, AND in just the same position, AND I was able to notice the similarity...the odds of this happening WHILE I had a camera ready to take the photo were mind-boggling!

This is what I would really call being in "high humour", I guess!

The house is on the Ring Road just before the place where to-be-constructed road (the piece of land is under litigation) joins up with Bannerghatta  Road. When coming from Hosur, you take a turn on to this road and then, just past this house, take a turn to the right and go bumping for about 2 km and join Bannerghatta Road.
