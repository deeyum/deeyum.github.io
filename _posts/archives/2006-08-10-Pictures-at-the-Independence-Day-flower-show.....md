.....


I took plenty of photos, after all...I actually figured out which lens to take, and attached it and went off to Lalbagh on a sudden impulse, to see the flower show that is put up every year for Independence Day (August 15).....

But here are the first three. Remember I am NOT a photographer. 

First, the Indian flag in anthuriums...the arrangement was already wilting, wonder how it will look on the 15th!

Then I have these two...the first one is this lady, at the end of&nbsp; a hard day's work, taking something living and growing, home with her....

and the next one is titled, Restof Lalbagh....this is one way to enjoy Lalbagh without seeing a single thing!
