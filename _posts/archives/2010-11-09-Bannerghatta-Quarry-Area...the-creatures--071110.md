The quarry area is where I sighted my first Egyptian Vulture in south Bangalore, so it's always with eagerness that I go there. This time, of course, the lowering skies and the drizzle made it impossible to see too much, and I was able to photograph even less...but it was beautiful, nevertheless, to get some creatures on camera!


Krupa and I have a kind of arrangement...the minute he leaves my side for a minute or two, I sight something interesting! (And, according to him, I make it worse by photographing it and showing him the photograph as well!) There was no exception this day; the first time he went a little further with Chandu, I spotted this 

GREATER FLAMEBACK WOODPECKER

male in the tree...it sat SO still that I started wondering if I had seen a bird or the branch of a tree, as it was also far away! But the camera does not lie....

The second time we parted company, I was really thrilled to sight the migrant

PIED CRESTED CUCKOO

atop a tree (naturally it flew off in the minute or two that he took to come over!)

Chandu spotted this 

BRAHMINY STARLING

on the bamboo:

(photography is tough in a fine drizzle!)

However, the sighting of the day was definitely this 

RUFOUS-TAILED LARK

which foraged around, unfazed by the presence of our car, right next to the road...even at such a closeup, you can see what a great job of camouflage the bird can achieve! The colouring of the bird closely approximates the mud on which it moves about....

I got a nice portrait, too:

Here's another of my "birds as they appear to us" photo...can you spot the

GREY FRANCOLIN

in the picture?

We enjoyed seeing three kinds of Munias...the SCALY-BREASTED, the WHITE-RUMPED, and these beautiful

BLACK-HEADED MUNIAS:

doesn't it make a delightful picture in the reeds?


Apart from the birds, and the 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/736082.html"> Ladybird </a>

that I posted about, I got this beautiful, tiny

SPIDER 

on a small sheaf of grass; Karthik has promised to id it for me:

I was intrigued by the perfectly round holes in the rock, here and there, until Karthik told me they were probably drilled by men, to put in dynamite for the blasting!

I snapped a tiny wildflower, which Karthik says, is probably

HYDANTHES:

The moisture meant there were 

MUSHROOMS

everywhere....little brown umbrellas...

and very delicate white ones:
