Plenty of poets have written words
About the moon in June...
But it's lucky that I can write
About the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon">Supermoon </a> !

At least I wanted to, but alas,
The clouds hid it from sight.
So I decided to post the pics I took
Of the moon, the previous night!

When I see the moon like this,
I can almost see the astronauts..
Stepping gently on lunar soil.
Even my poetic thoughts

Are so down-to-earth! (Or are they
Up-to-moon? I wonder...)
When the moon makes others think of love...
I think,"Apollo 11"...that's my blunder!
