From BR Hills, we came back via Mysore to enable my nephew to see the Mysore Palace. The crowds thronging the Palace were incredible, and I didn't really want to go inside and get pushed around

What quickly helped me decide to stay outside was....that I looked up at the Palace spires....and there were these two:

That's at full zoom on the MLC, I thought...but then, one of them a little lower, as if to say hello:

And it was a lovely sight to see it against the dome:

I spent the rest of the time, while everyone went around the Palace, to wander around the grounds, enjoying the crowds....but this unexpected bonanza of two 

EGYPTIAN VULTURES, 

soaring high over the Palaces, lifted my heart to their height!
