Since she only had a couple of four-wheelers (strollers), she tried

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/651266.html"> asking her dad for the car keys </a>


but that didn't work...but now she does have a couple more four-wheelers!

Here's one that chauffeur-driven:

And this self-driven one has a gear-shift stick and an aerial, too.

She may not be great at getting down the stairs (she can go up great!)...watch that toe gingerly feeling for the next lower stair:

and then sliding down:

(what a perfect picture that pink bottom makes!)

but she's good at driving not only these two four-wheelers above, but also she also hikes across the wildernesses of the bathroom once she's on her potty! (I call it the Pee-Bus, and often, when I am downstairs in the morning before my "duty" starts, the scraping of the Pee-bus across the bathroom floor is my indication that she's up and active!)

The "no" was to prevent her from going beyond the bathroom!
