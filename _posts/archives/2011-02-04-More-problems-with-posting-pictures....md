Though I've posted the first days pics easily to Facebook, I am having problems with either Photobucket or this tablet laptop....I did post two pics to my Photobucket account, but I am not able to click on the HTML code link that is given under each picture, and post it to LJ as I usually do. I don't know if this is a problem with the site or the computer I am using...but the net result is that I am unable, still, to start writing about the Bharatpur/Chambal trip, and I have so many photos that I want to share with everyone!

Meanwhile,as other visits near, the trip recedes into the distance, and I am afraid that I may forget all the lovely details, and write less-than-thorough field trip reports...but if anyone would like to see the pictures from Bharatpur, the links to the photos on FaceBook are

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=275260&id=587058877"> here </a>

and

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=276696&id=587058877"> here </a>



I am particularly fond of

and had hoped to have it display on LJ...but I don't know when it's going to be possible!

Let's see when I can post more photos on LJ.... am too tech-unsavvy to diagnose where the problem lies!
