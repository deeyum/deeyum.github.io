My nephew has started a fast-food initiative, called 

<a href="http://chennai.burrp.com/listing/petawrap_mogappair_chennai_take-away-shops-fast-food-shops-road-side-stalls/1805218029"> Petawrap </a>

The name was suggested by the musician,

<a href="http://thisandtheother.com/"> Anil Srinivasan </a>

a witty take-off on the A R Rahman's hit song:

So...we decided to try out the wraps, and here we are:

I think we had (with just one exception) all the varieties on offer...and enjoyed the wraps very much!

Right across the service road, as we munched, I spotted these statues of some 

double-tailed devils....

<lj-cut text="who do these represent?">


I went up close, but apart from some murals of scenes from the North-East of India, there was nothing to explain what these were representations of....they seem to be of dancers made up in this way....it was another mystery to add to my wotzit list!

If anyone in Chennai knows what these statues are....do let me know!
