The flowers of Agumbe were varied and each was more beautiful than the others....as usual, there were only some I could id, and others remained mysterious; let me start with this exquisite three-petal wildflower that I spotted:

These purple flowers, too, smiled up in their hundreds on the hillsides:

This beautiful flower, from the tree called "Bixa orellana", was called "lipstick flower" by the people at the ARRS:

They broke one open to show us the seeds inside:

Sometimes, the fruit of the plant also looked very pretty:

These un id white flowers on stalks were everywhere on the hillside:

At several places I also saw this jasmine-like wildflower:

Even when the flowers had fallen off, the calyxes themselves looked lovely:

Technically, this picture is of MOSS SPORES, but I want to include it in the flower list as the sight is wonderful, with the rain water drops on them!

At some places, ORCHIDS had also sprung up on trees:

In keeping with the cobra research at the ARRS, even these flowers had a similar look! Here's one  COBRA LILY:

On the mossy rocks, this tiny little flower bloomed everywhere:

I loved the delicate lace of this leaf whose veins have been leached out as the vegetable matter disintegrated:

The AMORPHOPHYLLUS YAM flowers/fruiting bodies were very common, but no less striking for that:

A feast of colour, shape and form, the flowers on the hillside were a treat in themselves!
