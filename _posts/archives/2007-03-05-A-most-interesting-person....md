Here's a very interesting person whom DnA (as my daughter and son in law call themselves) brought into my life....

GRB designs bells and is a great artist as well.

Check out his website at

Go to his blog as well to see the new seahorse bells that he is in the process of designing...

An interesting incident that happened when he came over for the DnA wedding was that all the American men wanted to have mehendi on their hands, too; but Gordon asked me to make a Ganesha mehendi pattern on his pate! And Ganesha, hopefully, has ruled his intellect ever since....
