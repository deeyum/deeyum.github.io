I just want to see what appeals more, visually.


Here are two images, from Forest Park, St.Louis, at dusk, on 16th of July, 2011.


Here's the first image:

And here's the second:

I am also trying to see if a suggestion made by a friend should be followed, or not. So...please respond, whoever you are....and let me know!
