The gate is closed, excluding those who're late;
The leaf is fallen, alive no more;
They speak of loss of hope,the leaf and gate...
When one did not hear opportunity's knock at the door.

The gate's straight lines and  curves
The leaf's dry shape upon the ground...
Each of them just serves
To symbolize sadness profound.

The blues on the gate,colours of grief,
Seem wintry and bleak.
The warm hues of the leaf
However, seem to speak...
The gate will open, a new leaf will grow:
The snow will melt, once again the sun will glow:
Winter in Spring will get relief.
