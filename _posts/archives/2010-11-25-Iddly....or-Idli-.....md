The background:

I emailed a British birder who's coming to Bangalore, and wants to go birding, His visit is going to be on weekdays, when the expert birders are probably not going to be free. So we've been emailing back and forth, and I was trying tell him about 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshini_%28restaurant%29"> Darshini restaurants </a>

which, I think, are unique to Karnataka...

and about

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli"> iddli </a>


and having read the wiki, I am amazed at the history, and variety, of this "humble" (read everyday) south Indian breakfast food, which is so light, low-calorie, and delicious too!
