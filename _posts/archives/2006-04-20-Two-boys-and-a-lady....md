I was cycling to the bank today, and stopped as the traffic was heavy, as it always is in these little side-roads, since the flyover construction resumed. Two little urchins with their shorts just about hanging on to their bare-waisted torsos, and a little bicycle, came and stopped near me. The cycle being very unsteadily ridden by one little boy with the other running in attendance. The rider was about to get off, when the other little one, with complete disregard for anyone else but his "pupil", said: "If even that lady can ride a cycle, you can learn! Keep trying! Don't get off!".

This little Drona put the original Arjuna in the shade with his concentration on teaching his friend!

Too cute for words....should I laugh or weep?
