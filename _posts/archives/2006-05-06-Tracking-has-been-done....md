Remember the video footage of the clouded leopard  that I referred to earlier?

<LJ user="amoghavarsha"> tracked this down, it was grabbed off  a BBC programme, called Mountains, aired on 18th April...this was the last section of the programme. So maybe we will get to see it with better picture quality, soon on Animal Planet or Discovery or something...Amogh has been dowloading it and has promised to show it to me, he says the quality is much much better but it would take quite a long time to download. Will post when I see it!
