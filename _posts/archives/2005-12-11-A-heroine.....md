I have a friend, to whom I am not very close...but at the same time, I have a lot of affection for her, and our interaction has been very pleasant.

Just five weeks ago, she suffered a horrific bereavement. It was a most unexpected blow and she was reeling under it.

Yesterday, I found her up on a public stage, making a speech; she had organized a cultural event and was speaking at it. I can only imagine the courage she has used to pick up the pieces of her life and get going again; and the courage needed to face a world which never understands, which has to be met on its own terms.....to me, who knew her, her face appeared weighed down by sorrow; but she managed to speak quite calmly...

Amazing woman....to me, she is a heroine. It's not what life throws at you that matters; it is how, in the black midnight of your sorrow, you bravely get up and continue....

My friend...I am all admiration for you.
