Thanks for your visit and comments. Here is what I am doing to post in Tamil.

Step 1) Will go to <A href="http://www.quillpad.com/tamil/">http://www.quillpad.com/tamil/</A> . It's a ver nice web based transliteration software, I have ever seen. It's very easy to use. Just try it out. 

Step 2) Copy the tamil contents and paste it in the journal entry.

Step 3) That's all.. :) You can also refer to this link. <A href="http://gilli.in/readwrite-in-tamil/">http://gilli.in/readwrite-in-tamil/<WBR></A>
