I was up at 5 am, getting ready so that we could leave for the hospital by 6.30 am (there's always that last-minute rush for the hot water!) and at 5.30 am, we get a call from the hospital, saying that many women came into the hospital in a state of advanced labour, so elective procedures like inducement of labour had been postponed...so DnA will probably get a call only this evening or tomorrow morning (more likely). All dressed and nowhere to go...DnA went right back to sleep but me, the insomniac...I went for a nice long walk!

It was neither rain nor even what we call a drizzle in India, but what is called a "fine Scotch mist"....when one can feel the moisture on one's face, but can't really feel the raindrops. It was a beautiful walk, and I came back with chilled hands and face (oh, it's been cloudy and cool here for the past 2 days, back from the HOT weather of Sunday), made myself some HOT coffee (which will not bear any comparison to the Park View baitu coffee) and wanted to have a nap, but meanwhile, I had to update D's parents, and <LJ user="itsalouwelylife">, too....

So..no nap; but on the walk, I got the New York Times, and the St Louis Dispatch, and learnt from the latter newspaper that there are now five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Tiger"> AMUR TIGERS </a> which are exactly one year old today, at the <a href="http://www.stlzoo.org/"> St Louis Zoo </a> ...since I seem to have a bonus day today, off I am going!

Here are <a href="http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/carnivores/amurtiger.htm"> the details about the Amur Tigers </a>.


Meanwhile, here are a few images of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch"> Gateway Arch </a>, the iconic structure of this city....

And an unusual shot of the Arch, as seen through an alleyway in the downtown area!

I may wind up writing about the baby tigers instead of the baby human.....
