How I miss the pre-monsoon showers in Bangalore! (But not too much, as <a href="http://weather.com" target="_blank">weather.com</a> tells me the high in Bangalore is 30 deg C, and it is 24 deg C in St.Louis...I propose to go for another long hike in Forest Park when I am done with housework!<br /><br />Some of the very common birds I&#39;d<br /><br />The Brown-headed Cowbirds and their mates seem to be out, and the &quot;treeeee!&quot; call of the Red-winged Blackbird can be heard everywhere. Mockingbirds and the immigrants....the European Starlings with their bronze-green sheen, and the House Sparrows....are briging forth families. The American Robin (called Robin Redbreast in Britain) also has babies trailing along, chirping loudly for worms.<br /><br />As I walk along Des Peres Creek, the Mallards and the Green Herons look up alertly at me in case I am coming to catch them.&nbsp; Several Kildeer are now to be seen on the grass along the banks...... A Snowy Egret quickly spears a fish,&nbsp; and takes it off. I go to watch the Great Horned Owls, but can see only the mother today....the other birds, such as the Common Grackle, also show their shining plumage, and as a bonus, I see the &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; Red-headed Woodpecker, at her nest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150819684993878.417256.587058877&amp;type=3" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/media/<wbr />set/?set=a.10150819684993878.<wbr />417256.587058877&amp;type=3</a><br /><br />The migratory warblers (they arrive in St.Louis in summer; alas, Missouri is not a hot-spot birding location, but it&#39;s great for my level of ignorance!)&nbsp; show themselves here and there, and once in a while, I get a lovely video like this:<br /><br /><a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/836849.html" target="_blank">http://deponti.livejournal.<wbr />com/836849.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br />This kind of nature ramble is certainly not the stuff of National Geographic...but it&#39;s my morning &quot;battery recharger&quot;, and I come home by 7am, ready to take on my daily duties, with a happy smile on my face, that lasts the whole day long. Just this morning, an elderly lady (er, I mean, MORE elderly than me!) smiled back at me and remarked, &quot;It&#39;s so nice to see a smiling face early in the morning.)<br /><br />I watch the mink family in the creek, which I&#39;ve been following from last year:<br /><br /><a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/826742.html" target="_blank">http://deponti.livejournal.<wbr />com/826742.html</a><br /><br />I can&#39;t see any young ones now, I was very lucky last year, as my friend Danny Brown informed me!<br /><br /><br />Dear Subbu...thank you for inspiring me, with your descriptive post,&nbsp; to write this....and Zafar Saab, I want you to know that halfway around the world, when I joined&nbsp; the Audubon Society&#39;s monthly bird-watching outing (exactly like our Lalbagh outing)&nbsp; this time,&nbsp; there were THREE people who knew about you, and were awed to think that I knew you personally.
