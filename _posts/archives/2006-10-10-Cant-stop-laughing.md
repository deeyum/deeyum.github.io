Missed several friends' posts on 7th October, for some reason...and decided to take the meme on <lj user="swatisani">'s LJ...and here's what I got:

<TABLE borderColor=black cellSpacing=0 width=250 align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle bgColor=black><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; COLOR: white">deponti's LJ stalker is mewpsych!</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align=middle bgColor=white><FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">mewpsych is stalking you because they heard you are awesome in bed, and they want to find out. They are also in jail for murder!</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><DIV align=center>
