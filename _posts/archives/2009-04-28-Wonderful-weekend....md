We had a packed weekend, on Sunday, we went to see the Chinese festival and parade in the Missouri Botanical Center, and the show was very good indeed. Then our daughter picked us up and took us for a drive downtown, and this was the first time that I clicked all the touristy images of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch"> Gateway Arch </a>...

I was supposed to upload several pics to my Photobucket site today...but a series of errands to run and jobs to finish took care of the entire time! 

We are off to the hospital tomorrow, where labour will be induced; let's see what happens....obviously, I just might be off LJ for a while as I make the transition to grandparenthood!

But let me leave you with this wonderful mass of tulips at the Missouri Botanical Center...

Well, if you click on that, it will take you back to my Photobucket site and you can see the other images that I have uploaded...very touristy, except for this one which is for <LJ user="beast_666">....
