The best form of teaching is not just imparting information, or even letting the student synthesize that information into knowledge...it is communicating the love of that knowledge to the student, so that forever after, the student loves learning more about the subject and is always ready to learn. How few teachers actually accomplish this!

This thought was prompted by a very long chat with 

<a href="http://toroid.org/ams/etc/"> AMS </a>

about teaching and how to learn to teach better...our conversations are always very interesting.
