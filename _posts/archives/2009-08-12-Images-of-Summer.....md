Some images that struck me...these were in 

<a href="http://www.towergrovepark.org/">Tower Grove Park </a>

(can you imagine every park in Bangalore having a website?)

 where we went on Saturday for 

<a href="http://www.ashanet.org/"> ASHA for Education </a> 

for their joint fund-raising initiative with 

<a href="http://www.netipstl.org/"> NetIP St.Louis </a>


it was called "Pakoras in the Park".. Net IP has given some funds for ASHA and members of both organizations met over pakoras, chaat, chai and soft drinks....and I *think* also beer....

It was rather warm weather, but I loved the idea someone in the Park Maintenance Dept had, of painting the park seat to match the flowers....

Here's the Turkish Pavilion (built 1872) where the event took place:

And where there is a tap or a fountain, you can always find children enjoying themselves!

You can go to the Asha homepage, but...do NOT click on the  St.Louis link, please....it downloads a Trojan virus....
