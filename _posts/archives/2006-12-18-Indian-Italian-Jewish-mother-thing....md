I seem to be waking up at about 5.30 am no matter where I am..and since we got back late last night and it is a Monday morning, I am now organizing packed lunch for DnA. 

I am NOT one of your devoted,maternal mothers, and am NOT a "make-rice-just-so-perfect" cook, but I do enjoy providing nice cooked meals for my youngsters, and helping with their home tasks while I am here. Many Indian parents I know do help out a LOT, and I have heard a lot of resentful comments about parents becoming unpaid help when they are in the US. Well...as far as I am concerned...I do enjoy it a lot. I know how hectic the pace of life is here and since I have enough time to spare from my own activiites...several hours' walk each day, internet, perhaps a half an hour of TV watching...I do enjoy the fact that in some small ways, my presence here is not an additional burden to them but is a help. But I suppose this is a two-way thing; DnA make it very clear that I am doing these little tasks of my own free will, and that they would carry on if I were not to do them. Indeed, my daughter is pretty prickly about my ever feeling that I am a unhired help! But the fact is, her kitchen is SO organized and handy, working is really enjoyable here...I do, however, like to get the cooking done and out of the way and then I enjoy the rest of the day with other activities. I enjoy planning about a day ahead.Tomorrow we run out of fresh vegetables, so I will see what happens!

It is strange...I thought I was NOT the typical Indian/Italian/Jewish mother sterotype...but I still find myself wanting to help out with the housweork, and more importantly, providing food....so I suppose it is in my genes and let me not fight it!

Anyone for sambar, eggplant subji, and rice? I could pack your dabbas...
