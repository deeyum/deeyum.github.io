I've been itching to use the macro on the S30, so when a

flew into the house, I could not resist taking these shots before releasing it outside again:

Though it is apparently a pest in the US, the colours of the beetle are really lovely:

The coppery-bronze greeny sheen also makes for good camouflage against the twigs and leaves:

I don't think these beetles bite, but I handled them carefully, all the same; it was a delight to see the zzzzzzzipping off into the open air when I had finished my photography!
