Staples. A "staple" is something that is supposed to be very good...it forms the main part of what we eat, for example. But another kind of staple...those ubiquitous little twice-folded pieces of metal that hold two surfaces together...seems to be taking over the world. They are so popular that a famous chain of stationery is named after them!

I've learnt to utterly detest staples. Every document of an official nature that arrives at my doorstep seems to be festooned with them.  A cheque or an important document is attached to the covering letter with one, the envelopes are often closed with two or three more, and several other staples seem to be added on in some random way, for what reason, I cannot fathom. 

What is even worse is that so many packets of foodstuff are stapled shut. Every so often, these staples make their way into the packets themselves, and are a deadly danger to the unwary consumer. I remember, long ago, finding a staple in a dish of pulao that I'd ordered (it was the Peacock restaurant that used to be on Residency Road) and I promptly quipped that "rice is our staple diet, and the restaurant cooks know that!"

 I googled around and can't see much on the impact that staples have on the environment...but surely millions of small pieces of sharp metal can't be a Good Thing! 

So I was quite happy when a forward from Padma Kanani of Kalanjali gave the following news:

"Environmental company creates a staple-free stapler to avoid staple pollution.


"Staples are supposed to be so bad to the environment that a company decided to create a staple-free stapler. This product promises to make collation eco-friendly. Instead of using those thin metal planet-killers, the staple-free stapler "cuts out tiny strips of paper and uses the strips to stitch up to five pieces of paper together." You can even order them customized with your corporate logo so you can, you know, brag about what your company is doing to stop the staple epidemic."

I would like to use one, but first I have to first find out how it works! Goodbye to the "staple" diet hereafter! Let me google and find out where I can get one...or, alternatively, I resolve to use only paper clips...and reuse them, too. Can anyone tell me who makes this eco-friendly stapler?

This post is for Venkat Mangudi, whose post on Facebook, and Gabin's comment on it,  got me back to the subject of staples!
