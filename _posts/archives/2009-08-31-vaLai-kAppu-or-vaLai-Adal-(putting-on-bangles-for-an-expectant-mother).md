Approaching motherhood
Colours one's life, one's thoughts.
So it's fitting
That one's hands and wrists
Are filled with colour, too;
The rainbows that the little one will soon bring,
The good wishes that friends pour into one's life,
And the prayer that the baby will be healthy and happy.

The baby for whom this was done is now more than a year old! :) And she is a real delight.
