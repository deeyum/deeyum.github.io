As PC and I walked to Roxen Lake, I suddenly saw this beautiful sight...a

EURASIAN TREE SPARROW

was feeding its young one.

The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia.

 This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. 

Adults use a variety of wetlands when foraging for invertebrate prey to feed nestlings, and aquatic sites play a key role in providing adequate diversity and availability of suitable invertebrate prey to allow successful chick rearing throughout the long breeding season.

Parents, as my friend Hema says, are the same the world over..doing a lot to ensure the survival of their children!
