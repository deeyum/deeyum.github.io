I remember, a few years ago, <LJ user="kalyan"> telling me that the hottest things were "tags". You could tag your entries and photos and be able to locate them instantly. Great stuff.
Now 
But there are some very idiotic tags, too...and those are the ones attached to all the clothes and cloth-based stuff that we buy nowadays.

When I was young, my tailor would sew on a discreet tag on the inside of my blouse, but it would be sewn to the blouse on all four sides. 

Nowadays, however, every item that's made of cloth must needs come with not one but TWO tags. One, of course, is the one you wish you could let hang out, because it displays the oh-so-cool brand of the item of clothing (and also shouts out loud the high price you have paid for it.) Alas, not all brands have cool logos like the little crocodile, which is easily visible and doesn't need a tag!

The seoond tag is the one that has to say what material the item is made of, and washing/cleaning/drying/care instructions for it. 


I am sure that there are a group of sadists in every garment manufacturing facility who sit and ponder where these tags can provide the maximum discomfort to the wearer.

If one tag is down the side seam of a garment, wouldn't you think that the logical place for the other tag is ALSO there? Of course not.

It *MUST* be a nice, stiff, pokey tag, jutting out from the back of the neckline, where it can poke you and poke you and poke you throughout the day and remind you that you ran over budget with this stupid  "Gup" tee shirt or that idiotic "Spike" polo.

Here's a little washcloth we bought for Eli; I have photographed a pencil on it for size reference.

Just look at the size of the tag on that cloth! Removing the tag from such cloths has become the bane of our lives now. D says probably there is a law against removing tags and I will be jailed without the option of  a fine if the garment manufacturers find out I have been snipping off tags!

WHY cannot the tags be sewn down on all four sides, when they will cease to be an abomination and a nuisance? WHY must they stick out so pokily?

I want to know if, when these tags are manufactured, they come with tags of their own...
