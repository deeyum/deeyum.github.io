When you're facing the summer sun
When your skin burns and it's no fun
To walk in the sunshine, it's too bright
The summer glare hurts your head and sight...
You've got mangoes on your mind....

You pick up the fruit, scattered all round
Or in the market they can be found.
Small and raw, or with golden ripe sheen
Or any of the stages that happen in between,
You've got mangoes on your mind....

Made into pickle or eaten with salt
Made into milkshakes or a thick juicy malt
Any of the numerous varieties you get
To crunch, or down your throat the smooth fruit you let
You've got mangoes on your mind....

Other times of the year, you may not really see
The beautiful leaves, the bark of this tree
But when the fruit in bunches is hung
About the mangoes paeans are sung!
You've got mangoes on your mind....

Summer is awful, hot and sticky,
About many fruits you're choosy and picky:
But when it comes to the King, mango...
Into transports of delight you go...
You've got mangoes on your mind!

and

is the fruit


Oh, this wonderful delectation...I am an Am aurat, and I am certainly an "Am Admi Paati"!
