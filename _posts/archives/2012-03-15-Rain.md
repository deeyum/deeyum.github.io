It's raining.
The air around me has cooled.
A refreshing breeze blows across
The newly-wet earth,
That gives off that incredible aroma.
Leaves shed their dust,
And will look green in the morning.
The rain will pass:
But the feelings ,,,, being refreshed
In mind and spirit...will remain.
Those...are the rainbows of the mind.
