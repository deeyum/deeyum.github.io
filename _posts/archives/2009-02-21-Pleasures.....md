The Cone of Joy....

My morning pleasure (especially on Saturdays, I have the Deccan Herald cryptic crossword, which is, I think, from the Daily Mail or something like that, and is so witty)...

That's all the coffee I have...half of that tiny cup, piping hot!

And...here are four people, whom I see sitting together and talking every evening; I call this picture the Four Haloes!

The evening sun lights up, not only their grey hair and heads, but also their experience of life, and their friendship. They, too, are in the evening of their life, but they seem to be contented, and  enjoying their daily tete-a-tete!


So, no matter what one's age, the simple pleasures of life keep us happy.
