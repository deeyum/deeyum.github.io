Here's a snap KM took of the Malabar Pied Hornbill...the picture has a very Japanese-painting feel to it, because of the tree and the bold curves of the bird....

Malabar Pied Hornbills are very large birds, weighing up to 4 kg sometimes; in spite of this, their flight (with a typical pattern of flap-flap-flap, glide...) is quite graceful, and the arc of their outstretched wings is so beautiful to see.
