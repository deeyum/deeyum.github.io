.....

We praise those who build new initiatives, new institutions, new efforts. Centuries later, the names of the kings or politicians(and once in a while, the architects who have constructed buildings)live on....but here are some of the people who ACTUALLY build.... to the nameless, faceless construction workers who work (still) for a pittance, often dangerously, to build the edifices of cement, glass, chrome and steel that help to create both Bangalore's wealth and&nbsp;her infrastructure&nbsp;problems. A salute to those who work on the scaffolding....the people who actually put brick and mortar together.

I am happy to see that most of them now have footwear, and hard hats...and that bamboo scaffolding has been replaced by re-usable pipe scaffolding, which is more secure and strong.
