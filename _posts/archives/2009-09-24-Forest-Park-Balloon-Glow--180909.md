Last Friday, we went to see the 

<a href="http://www.greatforestparkballoonrace.com/schedule.htm"> Balloon Glow </a>

in Forest Park.

There is something...er...uplifting about watching these gentle beauties glow in the night sky, and getting ready for the next day...

The balloons are always colourful:

A lot of preparation goes into getting them ready...

We could use a lot of political speeches instead of propane to produce the hot air....

Hopes rise along with the fabric:

There were less novelty-shaped balloons this year than before, but this old-fashioned one still looked lovely:

It was a crowd scene, though!

The "Farmers" Balloon is not agricultural, but sponsored by an insurance company!

This Pepsi can was hot and gas-filled, not cold and liquid-filled!

Of course we also had to try out some junk food, so we went to this stall

and tried the funnel cakes, which is batter that's deep fried, and then has castor sugar drizzled over it, it's deadly with the calories!

In Hindi, if you asked, "kis kA bob?" you would get the answer:

We enjoyed watching several youngsters living it up!

Of course everyone bought a lot of the junkola being sold, and were literally glowing with the fun they were having!

The evening ended with more fireworks, perhaps not quite as spectacular as the ones on the previous evening, just a short distance away on Art Hill, but beautiful, nevertheless!

The next day, DnA couldn't make it, so I went alone to the actual Balloon Race...photos coming up!
