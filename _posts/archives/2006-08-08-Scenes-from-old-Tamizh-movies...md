.....

I was watching songs on Thein Kinnam some time ago and one song was "Poo onru kaNdein" with Shivaji and another actor....and&nbsp;then&nbsp;watched Saroja Devi and another actress in the movie "Naadodi"..."Anroru naaL ithEy nilavil"...and my&nbsp;Californian friend who was watching&nbsp; said, they seem to show gay/lesbian &nbsp;relationships with no hesitation at all in your old movies.......that had never occurred to me! I am tickled about how the same scenes can be perceived so differently because of the culture one grows up in...! Just watched the second of the songs just now and thought of that other occasion...that's what brought this on. 

Has anyone else who watched these songs had these thoughts?
