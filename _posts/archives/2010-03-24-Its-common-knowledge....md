This is to illustrate the good old saying....

Until Picasa (or, rather, Google) rectifies its email-the-photographs facility (it's not been working since the 13th of March), all my files, uploaded to my Photobucket site the old-fashioned way, will be of this laaarge size...sorry!

I really cannot understand if Google is not able to rectify this feature with all those lick-smart people they have working for them...or they plan to permanently disable this feature...I cannot believe that something can stay "out of order" for ten days.
