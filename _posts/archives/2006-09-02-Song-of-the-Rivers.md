<P>.....


"Gangai yamunai inguthaan sangamam...."

" en tea kadaikku munnaadi paadara&nbsp; paattaa daa idhu?" 

("The rivers&nbsp;Ganges and the Yamuna meet in the Sangama here...."

"Why&nbsp; sing this song in front of my tea-shop?")

That was good for a laugh early in the morning...it arrived via email from a friend.
