No, I don't have that subject title wrong...

Every day, as I go about my morning chores, I take out one pan to heat my morning thimbleful (all I allow myself! caffeine! caffeine!) coffee, and I love the effect of the morning sunlight on it.

So yesterday I wasted some time capturing the effect...here it is on a towel:

Here, with the coffee in it:<a href="http://photos.ibibo.com/photos/viewphoto/8f8d4ec0bcab2ba838bc964b2e68480842-v1/2837604" title="Photo Sharing"><h1></h1><br /><img src="http://mdb4.ibibo.com/00353611a1bb16c7465645f5fe120c86770028d395e37af8dfde1a103d51e491b58a38d0fc90cff0d458b61f07aac043666170635.jpeg" /></a>


and here, on the polished granite of the kitchen counter (there's the green of the plants in my kitchen window, reflected in the granite too:

There's so much beauty in the kitchen in the morning....I don't feel it's drudgery at all! If only Cinderella had an S3, I think she would not be moping amongst the cinders, but trying to catch the glow of the embers and seeing if a high ISO would help....of course then, like me, she would be behindhand with her work and her stepmother would have something to say about that...
