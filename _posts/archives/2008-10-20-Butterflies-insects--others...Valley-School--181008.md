Due to the constant rain, the paths and slopes at the Valley School area were full of lush vegetation, and the wildflowers were out in their hundreds, too. Ideal conditions for butterflies and insects and all the "et cetera"s that make Life Under Foot so fascinating!

Of course, I am now a nice certified "L board" when it comes to butterfly id's as well. These creatures have got birds beaten hollow. You have the wings-open appearance,and you have the wings-closed appearance, the male, the female, the larva, the pupa...and just when you think you are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel it turns out that this is a butterfly which is mimicking another one! GRRRRRR!

Oh, well, following my usual practice of trying for  a couple hours or so on the Net,and if I can't get any positive id, ASK (Ask S Karthik), here are some:

A lovely ZEBRA BLUE:

A HEDGE BLUE;

I rather think this is the COMMON TIGER:

And this just might be the female of the WHITE ORANGE TIP:

This is the COMMON SAILOR, and unlike its flitting brethren, actually sat in one place until we were done photographing it:

Alas, I am still not able to get an id for this one:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_8187.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_8187.jpg" border="0" alt="some blue-white-black butterfly"></a>

This very common butterfly is the CRIMSON ROSE:

And Karthik tell me that this striking larva belongs to it:

This GARDEN LIZARD was out to get some insects:

And the cessation of the rain encouraged this little SNAIL to move its caravan:

Some iridiscent FLIES caught our eyes, shining in the morning sun:

And the BEES were busy, pollinating. You can see the pollen sac on the bee:

The skies were full of DRAGONFLIES (that's poetry) and I took a snap of these mini-helicopters:

and a close-up of one, (id help appreciated)

This fat, shiny MILLIPEDE came out to put its best thousand feet forward:

I had *just* finished saying, "I found GIANT WOOD SPIDERS even in Lalbagh, why aren't there any here?" and we immediately walked nearly into a bunch of them!

I loved the green of the MOSS on this wall:

We walked through a place where, due to a political quarrel, the art buildings of a  school had been pulled down by the authorities  (I don't want to go more into detail). This beautiful piece bears mute witness to the wanton destruction:

This beautiful, armoured BEETLE was happily going about its business, unaware that it was being photographed at close quarters!

If anyone can give me any help at all with the flower, insect or any other id's, I will be very grateful....that is, I will be full of grate...!
