Anonymous art can be unexpected and beautiful..


<a href="http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/blogs/show_entry/667"> take a look at this </a>

I wanted to crop the photograph to show only the face..but decided to keep the background in, too!


Off to Assam for several days... I know my LJ friends will pen all their most interesting, awesome and intriguing posts immediately I am off the net!

Wish me lots of luck with sightings in Kaziranga....
