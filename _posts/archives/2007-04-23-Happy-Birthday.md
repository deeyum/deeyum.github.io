Happy Birthday to two people whom I find impressive; one being <LJ user="yathin">, whose knowledge of many aspects of Nature,and whose great photography and descriptions give me a lot of good moments; and the other one being LS, my sambandhi (my son in law's mother)who has been a shining example of what a happy, fulfilled woman can be and how much she can achieve with grace and dignity.

Wish you the very best as you enter another new year of your life.
