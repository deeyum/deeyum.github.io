As we went around the area from which we could see the bald eagles at Alton, we saw these gulls wheeling over and around the reservoir. They keep shitting all over the gates. what is amazing, though, is that one of these by-products has actually taken on the likeness of a gull itself!

Look at the marking under the third and fourth gull from the left...and tell me, doesn't it look like a gull, beak and eye and all? Ha, self-portrait in Gull guano...!
