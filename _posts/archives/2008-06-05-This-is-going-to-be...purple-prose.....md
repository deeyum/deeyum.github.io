Yesterday I saw what I thought was the Purple Sari Club on their annual convocation....

I went up to them and asked them who they were, but they were very evasive. First someone said they were all domestics in someone's house; I was pretty impressed that all of them had been given uniforms, even though I might not have chosen the same colour...then another one said they worked "somewhere else" and were having a meeting....aha, the workers of the world (at least the purple-clad ones) are rising against the corrupt capitalists? 

They carefully stopped talking until I left the scene! I am full of curiosity now about who they are, and what they were discussing...
