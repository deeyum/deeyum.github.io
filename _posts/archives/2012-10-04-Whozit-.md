I look at the pile-up of emails.
From my male friends, and females.
Amongst the whole varied lot
There is one precious one that I spot.
Like a miser, I save it away
To look at, later in the day
When my regular work is done
When I take a break from the run
I savour this mail from my friend.
It gives me joy without end.
Who is this email from, so
Blessedly dear? Wouldn't you like to know!
