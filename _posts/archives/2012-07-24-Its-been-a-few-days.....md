...since I last posted, and goodness knows how I coped...but I feel happy to report that I *have* coped.

I returned to an empty house, with the contents of all the cupboards strewn about as the painters were painting the inside of all of them....could not find a single thing, there was no telephone, no internet...it was total chaos, accurately reflecting the chaos in my mind as I began the first day of the rest of my life....by myself.

Over the past week, I have turned out even more cupboards, and got most of the flat painting and allied jobs done, and though the flat is still looking as if a whirlwind has passed through it, it now is a smaller whirlwind. (Yesterday I could not even sleep on my bed as my clothes were scattered all over it....I slept on the couch.)

But with it all, I've managed to attend the regular 3rd Sunday outing to Bannerghatta, to take an NTP trip to Yercaud, and catch up with friends, too...and keep up with photography and posting, too. Yes, in the process, LJ and WordPress fell through...but my thoughts have been chaotic, and really not worth expressing at all..so negative have they been, most of the time.

But I have people like <lj user="idahoswede"> as examples, so how can I remain down? The jet lag is slowly going away in spite of being extended due to the presence of workmen in the home all day...and my mind, too, is getting calmer. I'm off to Chennai today (back late tomorrow night) to see the people who probably are the only "family" I have left.

But I'll leave you with the entertaining patter of this magician, who performed just before the show of Disney's "Aladdin" (the musical) that I went to watch before leaving St.Louis.

Funny....an Indian going all the way to America to watch the *American* rope trick!
