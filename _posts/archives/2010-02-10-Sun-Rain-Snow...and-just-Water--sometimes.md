I am amazed at how the quality of the light changes....when the rain threatens, it's dark and everything gets tinged with grey, as when we were leaving for our safari on the first day of the NTP meet:

that was at 4pm!

When the rain comes down, of course, the light itself takes on a watery quality...here's the Crested Serpent Eagle, taken through a practically solid curtain of water!

Then the rain lets up, and the sunbeams try to pierce through the shower, and the light takes on a golden hue:

The sun does break through again....

When snow is already on the ground with more coming in, the quality of light is much more white...it's a time when the sky and the road are the same colour....

The sunlight appears weak...

The light shows up white everywhere...as D shovels the snow off the path:

Then, the sun breaks through the snow clouds, too....

The quality of the light then is prismatic...showing up all the colours of the rainbow...

The sun, rain and snow...they beguile me...and my camera...and sometimes, it's light through water, of a different kind. This is what I saw when the sun shone through the Hippo's pond (it has a fibreglass side, for visitors to view the hippos and the fish underwater):
