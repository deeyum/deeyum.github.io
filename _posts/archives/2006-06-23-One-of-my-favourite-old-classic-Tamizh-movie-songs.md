ROUGH (very rough) translation:

Let me ask you something, answer me truly:
If someone asks me to sing, what would I think of singing?

There's no more time to sing songs of love
(I)Haven't&nbsp; become a mother, to sing a lullaby

Singing when alone, and silent in the assembly;
The relationship is the musical mode, the life is the rhythm
The loving heart is not experienced....(if you ask a woman to sing, what will she think of&nbsp;singing?)

A sky without the moon:Clouds without moisture
Silent womanhood, a reality that doesn't sing
(It) will slowly close its eyes, and live, thinking of itself...(if you ask a woman to sing, what will she think of singing?)


Any corrections from anyone...welcome!
