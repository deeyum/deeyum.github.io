Yesterday evening, we watched this sudden <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite"> termite </a>  swarm in Indira Nagar...


We saw the termites flying in their hundreds, around the street lamps:

I tried to get them against the light, but only got this image:

Nabeel Mohamed, another person intrigued by the swarming, was trying to capture the image of the termites coming out of the ground on his mobile phone camera:

You can see the hundreds of non-winged grubs as well if you look closely:

<a href="<http://www.wildwander.com>"> Karthik </a> had told me about these termites, so I decided to look it up on the net, and here's some info about termite swarms:

<a href="http://www.terminix.com/Services/Termite/Termite-or-Ant/default.aspx"> one </a>


<a href="http://www.asktheexterminator.com/termites/Termite_Swarms.shtml"> two </a>


<a href="http://www.animalpicturesarchive.com/view.php?tid=3&did=28077"> and three </a>


Pity that such a lovely sight actually means...destructive pests! These termites are called "eeshal" in Tamizh, and Shashidhar Bellur (NTP) informs me that they are called "geddalu" or "gejjalu" in Kannada.
