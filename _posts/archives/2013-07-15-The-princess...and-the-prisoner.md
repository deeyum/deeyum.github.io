It's Sunday morning, and our little Pink Princess has come downstairs, decked in her tiara, two pearl necklaces...

She also is a train that runs up and down the front porch while a brefus of fried eggs is being made:

Meanwhile, our little victim is trying his best to escape from his Gulag:

Being able to turn over since last week is the first step in his getaway plans.

I'm off to visit Cahokia Mounds, now, and leaving this chaos behind for a while!
