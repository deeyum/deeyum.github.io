While in Memphis, we also spent a morning at 

<a href="http://www.shelbyfarmspark.org/"> Shelby Farms </a>

and this satisfied all of us...it had a playground for KTB, a running track for Rani and A, and a nice woodsy area for me, with a stretch of water as well.

As I went along, I got this 

RED ADMIRAL

with both its dorsal view:

<lj-cut text="more of these creatures">

And its ventral view, which is just as beautiful:

After seeing something that used the air to move, I looked at these

BLUE-WINGED TEALS
on the water:

And, on the shore, some 

MALLARD

females sat comfortably:

I was arrested by the

ROMAN TUFTED DUCK

couple:

Can you imagine, being in America, sitting in the named-after-Egypt city of Memphis, and looking at a Roman duck!

</lj-cut>

Quite a regal presence,and with that appearance, I'd personally call it a Brahminy Duck!

I also was able to capture this

MEADOW VOLE:

Here it is, eating:

Let me close with some beautiful flowers, can someone tell me its name?
