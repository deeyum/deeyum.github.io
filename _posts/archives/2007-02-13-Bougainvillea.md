Such a common plant, hardy and low-maintenance, and supports a lot of birdlife, too...and always looks good, growing well even in arid regions.

There are so many colours, from the vivid scarlet to the white; I found this golden colour very appealing. The plant had grown wild. I call the Bougainvillea the "flaunt plant" as the real flowers are tiny and in between the colourful bracts that the plant flaunts!
