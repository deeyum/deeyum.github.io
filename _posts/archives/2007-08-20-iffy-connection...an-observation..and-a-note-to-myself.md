I had wanted to continue work on the Lake Manyara post (it's  just begun and I have saved it as a "my-eyes-only" post for now) and upload some videos to YouTube, but my internet connection didn't permit any work at all today...no one ever told me how longggggg it takes for just a one-minute video to upload to YouTube! Truly, when one sees all that wonderful photography and stuff on the net, it all looks so attractive, it's only when  you start doing it yourself that you realize that there's a lot of hard work, and frustration at the internet connection, behind it all...

At this rate, I will forget all the details before I have a chance to write the commentary to the pictures...!

But meanwhile, KM and I went to a concert at Chowdiah Memorial Hall this evening...and I posted this to Metroblogs:

Do others have the same experiences in other venues?

And as a general observation...I do wish performers would realize when the ascending curve of their fame intersects with the descending curve of their performance quality, and quit while they are still deserving of the praise heaped on them. But no; with all the hype, the artiste does not realize the point at which the ego, swollen by the fulsome praise of the hangers-on and camp followers, begins to outstrip the talent (which often wanes with age), and if s/he would only look dispassionately, would realize the real meaning of the fact that members of the audience are walking out. But no; the divas cling on, and there is always one more performance, and each is less than the previous one, but the artiste chooses to believe the orotund laudatory praises of the organizers, when what s/he should be doing is to quit and be remembered at the height of hes powers.

Reminds me of one the Romantic poets' (either Shelley or Keats, I forget which) sarcasm about the efforts of a would-be singer:

"Swans sing before they die...'twere no bad thing
Should certain persons die before they sing!"

I would change that a little to read,

"After they've been stars and with fame had their fling,
Performers should stop, and never dance, act or sing!"

And as another general observation...note to myself...no matter how angry I am with someone, when that someone apologizes, I must accept the apology. When a person is sorry enough to say so, it is like a slap in the face to hem, if the apology is not accepted or is denigrated as just being facile words..and might very well start a fresh set of problems!  I must always assume  that the apology is genuine and sincere, and realize that at any time, I could be in the other person's position, too. Even if I am hurting, I should put aside my feelings and appreciate that the other person is trying to make amends.

I might tell  the other person  that I am still hurting, or convey that I have completely got over the incident;that depends on how I am feeling at the time...but...I *must* accept the apology whole-heartedly. And...I must remember that, not forget it in a moment of anger! Or *I* might hurt the other person's feelings,and have to wind up apologizing, too...
