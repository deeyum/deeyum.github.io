I watched two almost identical retrospectives on 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Bhosle"> Asha Bhonsle </a>

one, Rangoli, that airs at 8am on Sundays, and the other, Flashback on NDTV,

and realized that it was Asha's 78th birthday on the 8th of September. What a talent! What a voice! What a range of songs! And she always comes across as a good person, too. 

So...a salute to a wonderful artiste, with the first song that was played on Rangoli today:

Here are the transliterated lyrics:


Mera kuch saamaan tumhare paas pada hai -2
o o o ! saavan ke kuch bheege bheege din rakhe hain
aur mere ik khat main lipti raat padi hai
vo raat bhulaa do, mera vo saamaan lauta do - 2
mera kuch saamaan tumhaare paas pada hai - 2

patjhad hai kcuh ... hai na ?
o ! patjhas main kuch patton ke girne kee aahat
kaanon main ek baar pahan ke laut aai thee
patajhad kee vo saakh abhi tak kaanp rahi hai
vo saakh gira do, mera vo saamaan lauta do - 2

ek akeli chhataree main jab aadhe aadhe bheeg rahe the - 2
aadhe sookhe aadhe geele, sukha to main le aaye thee
geela man shayad bistar ke paas pada ho
vo bhijwa do, mera vo saamaan lauta do

ek so sola chaand ki ratain ek tumhare kaandhe ka til - 2
geeli mahendi ki khushbu, jhoot mooth ke shikwe kuch
jhooth mooth ke wade sab yaad karaa do
sab bhijwa do, mera vo saamaan lauta do - 2

ek ijaazat de do bas, jab isako dafanaaungee
main bhi vaheen so jaungee
main bhi vaheen so jaungee


Very rough translation:


Some of my things are lying with you...
Some monsoon days are kept there,
And a night, wrapped in my letter, is lying there...
Forget that night, send me my things..

The feeling of the falling leaves of autumn...
I'd worn them once in my ears and returned..
That autumn leaf is trembling yet.
Drop that leaf...return my things...

When, under one shared umbrella,
We were both half wet...
Half-wet,half-dry, what was dry, I had brought along...
The wet mind is probably lying next to the bed..
Send it back, return my things...

One hundred and sixteen moonlit nights, the mole on your shoulder...
The smell of wet henna, some faux complaints...
Some false promises, too...remember them;
Send them all...return my things....

Just give me  permission;
When I bury these,
I'll also lay down  there...
I'll also lay down there.

What haunting lyrics by Gulzar!


One of the hundreds of songs that she's sung so beautifully....
