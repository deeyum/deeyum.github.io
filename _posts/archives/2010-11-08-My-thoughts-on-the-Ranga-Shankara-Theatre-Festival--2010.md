To write this short article, I had to:

1. attend about 80% of the performances, including the platform performances, spending several hours at Ranga Shankara; 

2. take  about 35 photographs 

I got harassed by various Ranga Shankara volunteers about "photography is not allowed" though I did have permission to photograph if I did not use a flash. 

Out of these images, a few have been used in the online version and two in the print edition.

It's lucky that I am very intersted in theatre; the average newspaper reporter would obviously have been bored to death, which is why, I suppose, the normal writeups are often full of inaccuracies...
