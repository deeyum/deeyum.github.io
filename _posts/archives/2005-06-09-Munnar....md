Went for a road trip to Munnar in Kerala, with 2 other families....the Mahindra resort is very plush, but lacks a good place for a daily walk. The interesting thing is that mobile phones don't work there. It was a revelation watching the other adults coming to terms with non-communication for 4 days...absolute withdrawal symptoms! 

 A lorry driver has practically totalled our Honda City this evening, trying to go to the left from the centre of the road, and increasing the damage after hitting the car by trying to straighten out....he then ran away while my poor spouse was trying to park the car at the side and catch him. No police presence or help....the tyre burst, too, and it's going to be a long haul with the insurance and repairs....
