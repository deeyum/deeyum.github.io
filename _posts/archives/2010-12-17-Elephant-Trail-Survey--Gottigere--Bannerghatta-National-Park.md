I'd registered for this Survey, and am off to the Forest Dept Office at Gottigere shortly....will back with the tales (if not the tails and trunk)....and on Sunday, the 3rd Sunday bngbirds outing to the Bannerghatta area, this time to Jigani Lake.

Y'all have a great weekend until I come back to inflict myself upon you!
