Thanks to Santosh Oak for these.

yehI wafA kA silA hai, tO kOI bAth nahin.
yeh dard thum nE diyA hai,tO kOI bAth nahIn.

This is the reward for loyalty. It doesn't matter
You've given (me) this pain; it doesn't matter

yehI bohot hai ke thum dekhtE hO sAhil sE.
safeena doob raha hai, tO kOI bAth nahIn

It's enough that you are watching from the shore.
The boat is sinking; it doesn't matter.

rakhA thA makAn-e-dil mEin chhupA kE thumkO.
Woh makAn tumnE chhOd diyA hai,tO kOI bAth nahIn.


I'd hidden you in the house of my heart.
You broke that house; it doesn't matter.

thum hI nE AyInA-e-dil mErA banAyA thA
thum hI nE thOd diyA hai,tO kOI bAth nahIn.

It was you who made a mirror of my heart.
It's you who broke it; it doesn't matter


kis kI majAl kahE kOi mujh kO dIwAnA
agar yEh thumnE kahA,tO kOI bAth nahIn

Who has the courage to say I'm a madman?
If it's you who say so, it doesn't matter.


*********
therE husne kE hum dIwAnE hO gayE
thuhjhE apnA banAthE banAthE hum khud sE begAnE hO gayE
na chhOdnA mujhE thU,  aey zAlim
therE karIb Akar hum duniyA sE dUr hO gayE

I've gone crazy over your smile
In making you mine, I've become a stranger to myself
Don't leave me, O cruel one
I've come close to you and left the world far behind

**********

milan kI rut sE mohbbat kO tarasnE wAlOn,
akElE baitth kE rOnA bhI pyAr hOthA hai.

To those who are thinking of love as the moment of meeting,
Sitting alone and weeping is also love.

*************

jab dEkhA unhOnE tirchI nazar sE,
kasam khudA kI,  madhOsh hO gayE ham

When she looked with that sidelong glance,
By God, we were entranced

par jab pathA chalA, nazar permanent tirchi hai...
thO wohIn khhadE-kbhadE behOsh hI gayE ham.

But when we realized that she's cross-eyed...
We fainted as we stood there!

**************

AnkhOn mEin namI thI,
aur vitamin kI kamI thI..
jis sE rAth bhar chatting kI 
wOh  girlfriend kI  mummy thI..

My eyes were moist,
And weakened with a lack of vitamins.
The one I'd chatted to all night
Was my girlfriend's mother...

******************

kOI patthar sE nA mArE
mErE dIwAnE kO...
nuclear power kA zamAnA hai,
bomb sE udA dO sAlE kO.

(2 lines from a famous movie song from "jawAnI dIwAnI":

let not anyone stone my love:
It's the day of nuclear power, kill the sob with a bomb.

***************

tAj mehal kyA chIz hai, 
issE  badi imArath banAUngA.
Mumtaz thO mar kE dafan huI thI.
tujhE thO mein zindA dafnAUngA.

The Taj Mahal is nothing great.
I'll make a bigger monument than that for you.
Mumtaz was interred there after she died:
I can inter you alive.

****************

hasIn kE liyE gam kurbAn, 
khushI kE liyE AnsU kurbAn, 
dOstb kE liyE jAn bhI kurbAn, 
aur agar dOstj kI girlfreind mil jAyE thO...
sAlA dOsth bhI kurbAn.

Pain can be sacrificed for one who smiles;
Tears can be sacrificed for happiness;
Life itself can be sacrificed for a friend;
And if one can get the friend's girlfriend,
Then...the friend can also be sacrificed.
