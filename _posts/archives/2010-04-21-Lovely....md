DnA had both taken the day off, and just now they suddenly decided to go to

<a href="http://mdc.mo.gov/areas/cnc/powder/"> the Powder Valley Conservation Nature Center </a>

for today's event.

It's a beautiful day...I am off to the forests and trails...what more do I want!

Hopefully, I'll get to see some nice things :)
