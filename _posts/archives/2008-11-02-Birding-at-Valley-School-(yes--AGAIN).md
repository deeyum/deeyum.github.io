One of my favourite spots is the Valley School area.This morning, <LJ user="anushsh">, Jaimon, <a href="http://fotodreamz.blogspot.com/"> Mahesh </a>,KM and I went there  for a very enjoyable morning of birding....we met up with <a href="http://bonerpakhi.wordpress.com/"> Garima Bhatia </a>, Gayathri Naik and Madhavi.....more about the birds and animals we saw, later, but here are two photographs of what the morning sunlight looked like through the foliage...
