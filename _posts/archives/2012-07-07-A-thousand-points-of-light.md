Quickly flaring, as quickly quenched,
In the sky ocean;
In all colours,
In outward-spiralling motion.

We have a Tamil saying,
"Don't make carbon of your money...
"Buy fireworks!" and indeed
The saying is witty...and funny.

It may not be prudent;
It may be waste;
But for that minute of wonder
We rush and watch, in haste

While the fireflowers bloom
Across the sky's velvet black,
We are lifted out of our daily cares
And to pure joy, wafted back.

Fleeting, evanescent,
Leaving smoke and murk...
But on our hearts they cast their spell.
In our gasps we see their magic work.
