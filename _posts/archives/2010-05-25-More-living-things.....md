After photographing the RED-TAILED HAWKS' nest, I walked back, trying to decide where to have my picnic lunch, which, in the heat and humidity, , had started weighing heavily on my shoulder....but as I walked, I stopped thinking about it, for this lovely yellow water lily greeted me:

<lj-cut text="more, including a sudden hummingbird">

I had, earlier, spotted this WOOD DUCK mother, shepherding her brood on the water:

Then this 

CHIPPING SPARROW

in the clover:

One not-very-common sighting was this 

CAPE MAY WARBLER

which Danny Brown and his friend Mark Haas both id'd for me:

this 

CEDAR WAXWING

was too high up in the tree to get a good shot:

so was this

RED-HEADED WOODPECKER:

the

EASTERN KINGBIRD
 
was flying near the river reeds:

The squirrels all seemed to have fresh new tails!

the Sycamore seeds looked plump and pretty!

even the Dandelion, that commonest of weeds, looked lovely:

I think these are

BLUEBELLS (Thanks, <LJ user="asakiyume">, for the correct Cow Vetch id!)

but I am not sure:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5415.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5415.jpg" border="0" alt="bluebells cc lake 220510"></a>

an unknown caterpillar had pupated, getting ready to issue forth as a butterrfly:

and a Mushroom had...well...mushroomed:


<LJ user="asakiyume"> could tell me if it was an edible one!



I walked past this bush, which seems like HOLLY  to me, but surely holly puts forth berries only during Christmas time?

As I crossed one part of Des Peres creek, I found a GREEN HERON  and a WESTERN  PAINTED TURTLE next to each other:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5522.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5522.jpg" border="0" alt="turtle and heron 230510"></a>

Then the heron decided to give the turtle a wide berth:
<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5523.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5523.jpg" border="0" alt="turtle 230510"></a>

I got the turtle in the water,

and the heron near it :

I decided I was quite hungry, and decided to stop at the Muny and have my lunch. As I took out my sandwich, I looked up and at the tops of the columns, the BARN SWALLOWS were making their nests:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5520.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5520.jpg" border="0" alt="barn swallow muny"></a>

It seemed it was a day of seeing parents and their homes!

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5518.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5518.jpg" border="0" alt="barn swallow nest 230510"></a>

I normally take "beelines" across the Park, heading in a straight line as far as possible. My return took me across the hot concrete parking lot of the Muny, and I was cursing myself for walking along that...but at the back of the Muny, I had a totally unexpected treat.

Something larger-than-a-bee whizzed past me...and yes! It WAS a

RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD 

(not hard to id, as this is the only Hummingbird in Missouri!), sipping nectar from the Pink Honeysuckle:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5503.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5503.jpg" border="0" alt="rthbird 2 230510"></a>

Out of that flower, and aiming for the next one!

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5504.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5504.jpg" border="0" alt="ruby-throated hummingbird muny 230510"></a>

</lj-cut>

Here, you can see the ruby throat of the bird's name:

I really had to whip the camera into these three shots as in a flash the bird disappeared!

Sunset found me very satisfied with my long, solitary ramble in Forest Park!
