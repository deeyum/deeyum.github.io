Email to the bngbirds egroup:

It was very pleasant to be able to go to Kaikondrahalli Kere after a long time and find that, apart from the dumping and levelling going on down one side of it, the lake is generally still well-maintained.

<lj-cut text="a pleasant morning">

An ambling walk of a couple of hours were very productive from the bird point of view, and we watched the nesting behaviour of the Great Cormorants,

 and the fishing by almost all of the waterfowl. Several juvenile Brahminy Kites, swooping at the surface of the water now and then, provided the raptor touch. 

The flock of Chestnut-tailed Starlings feeding on the Eucalyptus fruit pods made me muse on how species adapt even to exotic trees and utilize them.

Some of us compared notes over breakfast; there is a restaurant called "Sri Bhema's" around the corner which is ideal for the purpose!

Many thanks to Prarthana for organizing the outing though it was a little difficult for her. Her daughter Tanushree is developing into a good bird-spotter! There were several children on the walk this time, and it was heartening to see.

I have put up my album on FB,
