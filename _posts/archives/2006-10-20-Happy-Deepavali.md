....

Some say it with words, some say it with sweets, some say it with flowers...I say it with a kOlam!

And here are the lamps....I decided that this year, I would put flowers in the lamps instead of oil. And I threaded some serial lights instead...and I took this photograph without a flash, with none of the other room lights on....

I love the warm dark tones of the picture...it's nice and mysterious ...the way it is mysterious what I could have done to deserve such a wonderful life...a lot of us went down and lit some sparklers (no firecrackers though) and it was such a lovely, peaceful feeling.

I am now musing on how people who have suffered a loss carry on through times when everyone else around them is festive. The world carries on, but in their minds, the loss is agonizingly fresh....does every sight of&nbsp; celebrations open up the wound again? How are they able to cope with the memories of times when they, too, had nothing but happiness in their hearts?

Hmm....maybe I shouldn't put in negative thoughts in a festive post...but as I said, life seems to have&nbsp;both the happy and the sad side all mixed-up together...so my post is going to be like that, too.
