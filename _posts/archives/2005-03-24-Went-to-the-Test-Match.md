We went to the India-Pakistan Test Match, 1st day...surprisingly good crowd and traffic management, I found! The first two overs were very eventful, with Pakistan 6 for 2...but then the 3rd wicket partnership, which was 200 + when we left, began...it was nice to watch Inzamam Ul Haq take his 150 on the occasion of the 100th Test he was playing...and I thoroughly enjoyed all the sidelines, had my face painted in the tricolour, underwent Cricket 101 from my 7 year old neighbour who apparently knows every statistic there is about this game....I was able to follow the game much better than I thought, and had a really great time. If only the India Pakistan match was not so supercharged with jingoistic fervour! But that's the way it is (my neighbour would NOT have one half o his face painted with the Indian tricolour and the other with the Pakistani crescent and star!)
