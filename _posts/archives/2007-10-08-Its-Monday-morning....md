...all of us have to get into the weekly routine...but to keep me, at least, going, here's a picture of the sunrise on Saturday morning, with the promise of a beautiful weekend...

Surprisingly, the sun seems to be NEXT to the bright patch of sky! What eerie effects the monsoon gives us!

We did have a great weekend, though the political scenario and the ensuing traffic problems in Bengaluru aborted my trip to Tumkur to see the Slender Loris....politicians, the police and Bengaluru traffic ensured that I did *exactly* what I hate to do..drive 20 km to no purpose at all.
