I have been posting most of the funny signs I've snapped on Facebook

but I felt I must share this one....

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0323.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0323.jpg" border="0" alt="S 90% dscnt blr"></a>


A friend of mine replied to my query about why the sign was on its side, saying it was because...."the discount was heavy"!

I am now looking for a shop that gives me a 110% discount...that is, for every Rs.100 worth of merchandise, they will give it to me free and give me Rs.10 as well!
