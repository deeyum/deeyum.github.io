Feeling rather down tod-A
My ear looks as if it was stung by a B
Out of my right eye I can hardly C
Normally my health is robust and har-D
Health issues don't normally trouble m-E
Today, though, I feel blind and d-F
All because of this aller-G
Which, in Africa, I seemed to c-H
Sometimes it's itching of the I
My mood is just as blue as a J
My spirits on the floor along with the par-K
This allergy seems to have come from L
With sneezing, and lots of phl-M
I wish the doctor would tell me wh-N
I will be myself again! O,
That I could be bright once more, and hap-P
The doc would get a big than-Q
If I could keep from sneezing for 30 minutes...or an  R
That would make me happy,I conf-S.
I would behave with sani-T
Instead of hiding from people's v-U
As I scratch and look comtase and hea-V
(Hmm..I don't know how to write the W
In my literary muscles I don't have fl-X!)
I feel so dull..I wonder Y
I have to struggle with this aller-Z...
(Oh, do you pronounce Z as Z?
OK, there's that pronounciation, instead!)


Surprising, the depths to which I can descend when I don't have anything worthwhile to write about. Ah-CHOOO!
Oh, my goodness,it's been four weeks now, hope I get better soon!
