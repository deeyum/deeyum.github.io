Mebby...
My bebby...
Will come home for a while....
She'll step off the running wheel
And I can have as well as feel
Her presence and her smile....

Mebby...
My bebby...
Will not be able to get away...
Since she's always in my heart
Perhaps we're not far apart
But halfway across the world,sometimes, is far to stay

Mebby....
My bebby.....
Will come..or not..I don't know
In hoping, my heart is singing
As my thoughts go winging
To my child who left home long ago.
