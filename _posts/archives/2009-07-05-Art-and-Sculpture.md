It's very enjoyable to see a lot of art and sculpture as I walk around (before or after Forest Park, I walk around the University City area.)

In fact, just ten minutes' walk from home brings me to Delmar Station, where this sculpture was installed day before yesterday:

It doesn't seem to have a title...I am calling it the "Popcorn Tub Aggregation"!

<lj-cut text="more about sculpture, and lions">

The <a href="http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2W53"> Lions of University City </a> are celebrating their hundredth year, and some artists have been asked to depict life-size papier maiche statues of lions in their own way. Here's one, at the beginning of the Delmar Loop:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2308.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2308.jpg" border="0" alt="delmar loop lion 030709"></a>

And here's the title, and the name of the artist:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2309.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2309.jpg" border="0" alt="delmar loop lion sign"></a>

Another one, I think, is very witty indeed. This one is in front of the University City Library that I go to...this lion is made up of newsprint!


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2310.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2310.jpg" border="0" alt="city library lion 030709"></a>

And the title is very witty, too..."Reading Between The Lions"!


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2311.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2311.jpg" border="0" alt="reading between the lions sign"></a>

Unfortunately, some sculptures and their titles don't seem to match up. Remember <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/529237.html"> the papier maiche sculpture of the nude woman sitting and having coffee </a> , that's in front of a coffee shop? The title is:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_2324.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_2324.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

How can "sitting" and "reclining" be the same thing?
