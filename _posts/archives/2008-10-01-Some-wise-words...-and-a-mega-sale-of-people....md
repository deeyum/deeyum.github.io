Am just uploading the weekend pics to my photobucket site to post later, but meanwhile, here are some lovely words that I read as a child and have stuck with me:


He who knows and knows he knows,
He is a sage: seek him.
He who knows and knows not he knows,
He is asleep: wake him.
He who knows not and knows he knows not,
He is a child: teach him.
He who knows not, and knows not he knows not,
He is a fool: shun him!



And.. Looking for some good slaves? You want to buy gents, kids, and ladise too? Look no further (than the first line, that is!)

I wanted a maid,butler, masseuse, and others...but didn't find them...
