We were driving through Forest Park when I realized that this was a bird I was familiar with, but hadn't seen before in the US:

Well, here was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Turkey"> WILD TURKEY </a> crossing the road! (No, please don't immediately ask, "Why did the turkey cross the road?" ...that one IS a turkey!)


I got this shot of the bird at the side of the road:

I wonder how turkeys came to be associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving"> Thanksgiving </a>....! All turkeys must have been wild once, but nowadays the only wild thing about them is the wild rice that they are sometimes eaten with in this country!
