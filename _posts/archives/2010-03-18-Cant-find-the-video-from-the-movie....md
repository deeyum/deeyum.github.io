I wanted to listen to my favourite romantic song from "The Sound of Music"...."Something Good", sung by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer...but am unabe to find the original video clip anywhere...can someone help me?


I know the lyrics, but here they are, anyway:

Maria:]
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somwhere in my wicked, miserable past
There must have been a moment of truth

For here you are, standing there, loving me
Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

[Captain:]
For here you are, standing there, loving me
Whether or not you should

[Maria:]
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

[Maria and the Captain:]
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could

[Maria:]
So somewhere in my youth
[Captain:]
Or childhood
[Maria:]
I must have done something . . .
[Maria and the Captain:]
Something good


The other romantic song is "You Are Sixteen Going On Seventeen"...both sung in the same gazebo,  but with such different moods! The latter, the freshness of first love (that may or may not last!), and the former with the sweetness of mature affection... the young lovers dance and move fast; the older couple stand still, savouring each other's nearness. I did love contrasting these two songs from the time I first saw the movie (I think the movie came out in 1965, I was 11 at the time!)

Rodgers and Hammerstein...what wonderful musicians!
