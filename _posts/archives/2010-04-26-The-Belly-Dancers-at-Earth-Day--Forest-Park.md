A was a belly dancer for many years, and was very good at it, but finally, the pressures of work and approaching motherhood made her set aside this art form. However, this afternoon, when we went to the Earth Day festivities at Forest Park, we ran into several of her belly dancing friends, who said they were going to perform at the Pavilion....

I had forgotten what verve and grace belly dancers bring to the stage...and it was lovely recapturing it again!


They twirled lightly...

and the lead dancer almost literally spread her wings:

Here they are, slowly building up tempo:

and then they sway their hips (and bellies!) in the typical sinuous fashion:

We had a lot of fun looking at various "green" products and initiatives, too, at Earth Day:
