Can you imagine, me actually WORKING so hard that I could neither post, nor catch up with my friends' list? It actually happened today; two articles were past what I had determined to be the deadline for them...and phone instruments had to be repaired, and broadband installed in the new office... 


The weekend was a great experience, with the new batch of the Naturalists' Training Program that <a href="http;//www.wildwanderer.com"> Karthik </a> conducts.

One of the unusual features of this batch was that most of the members were not people coming together for the first time during the course, but were a well-knit group, called Junglescapes. For a nominal yearly fee, members of this organization go on wildlife trips, and are also involved in activities in the Bandipur area.

I got to know about them through my friend Shalini, and it was an added bonus that a young friend of mine (through Avinash) called Rachana Patwardhan, and KM, too, decided to take the course. 

I went on Saturday to find the group discussing the differences between various kinds of fauna ( doves/pigeons, frogs/toads, tortoises/turtles, and so on), and we took the Nature trail in the evening; we saw several birds ( I photographed much fewer of them!) during the weekend.

The first sight that met our eyes was this LITTLE CORMORANT sunning itself in typical fashion:

<lj-cut text="Birds of Bannerghatta....">

RED-VENTED BULBULS (including the rude fellow who showed me his red vent earlier) were everywhere:

I got this INDIAN ROBIN nestled in the foliage:

We suddenly spotted the ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD that I never fail to see at Bannerghatta; it was being mobbed by several RED-WHISKERED BULBULS:

Finally, the bird took off:

The BLUE-FACED MALKOHA is another evil bird which delights in teasing me with half-seen sightings hiding in the foliage of trees. Here's the half-leaves, half-bird shot:

I saw, for the first time, the GREY-BELLIED CUCKOO, sitting near another red-whiskered bulbul:

A GOLDEN ORIOLE made a beautiful sight as it came out of the foliage to sit on a bamboo shoot (probably forgot that I was around!)

Many people in the NTP enjoyed the flash of blue that the WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER brought:

Later, a red-vented bulbul decided to sit near the WHITE-BROWED BULBUL, a rarer cousin:

I had just finished wishing for a sighting of the EURASIAN EAGLE OWL when, lo and behold, we saw two on a rock. They (of course) flew away immediately, but not before KM got a foozly shot of one:

Since we managed to sight quite a few mammals, too, I will do a separate post on them, but let me close with this beautiful mushroom that Chandu pointed out to me:
