Here's a video of the dancing that he took last year:

There was a small stream:

There was a pretty wooden bridge across it:

Perhaps this gentleman was going over his memories, with that reminiscent smile on his face?

There were plenty of flowers blooming:

It is the custom on this day to wear crowns of wildflowers:

But that doesn't mean one can't be in touch with modernity!

Some kind of game with wooden skittles was being played:

So did this art gallery (it was closed, of course)

Of course, the Tourist Bureau was closed, too!

Let me close with this flower (probably a Columbine?)
