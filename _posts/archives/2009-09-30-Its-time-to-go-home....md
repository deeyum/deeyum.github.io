...for several reasons, some even more intense than others....one of them is the abcess that is growing into a kind of polyp from a badly-done root canal....luckily, it can wait until I get home, but it must be attended to immediately....

Good health is SUCH a precious thing, and so fragile; in a minute it just seems to vanish, the world turns upside down, and after that, one has to take things one day at a time...

Wish someone close to me were not being so severely tried....that person believes in astrology, I don't...but I'm hoping that the astrological guide to the sufferings, which we will also undergo in an indirect way, will find a path out of the suffering, pain and trouble...it's faith, actually, that will,hopefully, provide the key to overcoming this.
