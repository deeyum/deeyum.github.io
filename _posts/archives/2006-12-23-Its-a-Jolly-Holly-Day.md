We are leaving for Maine (Christmas), Connecticut (wedding on the 29th) , and then California (KM's entire family is getting together) , early tomorrow...don't know how my internet access will be...so here's wishing everyone a Merry Christmas with this spray of real holly, that I photographed just outside the St Louis Cathedral...
