When <LJ user="prashanthchengi"> was tending his bike, he asked me to take this snap of the cycle gears:

This was mounted on the bicycle wheel, which is called "chakra" in Sanskrit. It has 10 gears...or levels.

It reminded me of a spiritual aid, that has been worshipped for centuries in Hindu culture:

Here is the wiki entry about


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Yantra"> The Sri Chakra or the Sri Yantra </a>

Which has nine levels.

How apt, I felt, that the cycle, which is a "yantra" or instrument, has two "chakras", with gears that so closely resemble an ancient "chakra" or "yantra"! 

Kinetic energy does not, after all, seem to change much over many centuries! And cycling is a religion for many....
