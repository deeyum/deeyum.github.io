My daughter was very close to someone, until the other girl suddenly moved on.....I stood by, watching my daughter suffer. She had to go through this on her own, and grow by the experience. (We had tried to warn her about the other girl's selfishness, but she wouldn't hear a word, loyal friend that she was.)

This was published in Target, the children's magazine, so I can reproduce it. It was February 1995; she was all of sixteen...


I was always there for you
Whenever you needed someone
Through trying times and trouble
When you were in pain...
To share your sorrows....
I don't understand now
How you can forget that I'm there
And run off to someone else
Passing by me as though I don't exist.
So you need me only in times of strife
That I may comfort you
But when it comes to sharing happiness
It's not me you want
When I need someone--where are you?
Not with me...you don't even know
Nor do you care about what I feel
When you are with me, you are so full of yourself
And your problems that I try to help you with
That you never stop to notice my thoughts...
I never did matter, I suppose;
If I go away, would you miss me?
Or just find someone else?
You couldn't miss me for what I am
Because you don't know what I really am.
What I *am* is your friend..but it's not *friendship* we share...
For *that* is a two-way street.
