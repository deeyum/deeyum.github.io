No, that doesn't mean 50 medals, it means India's position in the medal tally in the Olympics is 50!

I just read <a href="http://premkudva.livejournal.com/908955.html"> Prem's entry </a>  about this....

That reminds me of one more anecdote about my brother. The unfailingly happy boy brought home a very bad report card. One being asked why he had such low marks, he said, "But see here! I have a very high rank!" (He was 25th out of 27 children!)

It was late in the evening on Sunday, and in the twilight I saw this  little sunbird trying to eat a fruit as large as itself, whole! The image is grainy and bad, but the greedy little bird made me laugh outright, so....

Food...no one is proof against gluttony.
