A close friend was very, very rude to me a few days ago. As this was on the phone, instead of reacting, I just put down the phone. Though I felt miserable, I just kept quiet for a few days...yesterday she called up and apologized, and explained how she was very upset over something else and had vented on me. 

Amazingly, I seem to have stumbled on the right way to handle these things. I would like to ensure that I always hold back from reacting, and let things cool down....a small price to pay for a long-enduring friendship. 

How to ensure that I learn from this experience and be wiser in future and not let my temper get the better of me? How to control my temper? A question that has been with me for so many years...with not many answers!
