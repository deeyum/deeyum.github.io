( KTB ran off somewhere instead of admiring her father's performance, you can hear me calling for her!)

This was at a Hawaiian Luau party, given by Urban Sprouts, KTB's daycare, for their third anniversary.

See the photos on my FB album:

Here are DS and KTB enjoying the sand and water (Hawaii is definitely about sand and water but in much larger amounts than this!)

Cleaning up after the party is also well in hand, and very organized!

Family parties are great fun. I met a lot of the children that KTB talks about, and met their parents, too.
