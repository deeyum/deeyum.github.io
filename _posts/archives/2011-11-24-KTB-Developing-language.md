KTB’s language is evolving and causes us much mirth on a regular basis.
 
One morning she stood in front of the fridge asking for “blood”. I was genuinely puzzled and wondered if she was perhaps asking for ketchup, something she loves. I offered it to her. She shook her head getting increasingly frustrated, until she just all out bawled, “Blooood. I need blooood. I need blood now!!”. I was finally able to satisfy my dracula child with what she wanted - a slice of… BREAD!
 
She also enjoys me singing the bhajan “Subramanyam” to her, and this morning I was treated with her request for “Sublam-mum-yum”.
 
K has always been one of the biggest poopers there has ever walked (or crawled) the earth. No wonder that she sometimes has a sore bum and has, in the past, asked for “medicine”. This week she said, “Amma, my bum hurts. I need sour cream”. Of course D and I could not keep a straight face. And she had no way of knowing that Dand I had a friend who used to call it “Sore cream”. She doesn’t always need the cream, but she really likes to play with the squishy tube. So last night as I put her pyjamas on, she looked at me so very hopefully. And with raised little eyebrows she asked, “Sour Cream ?”. She didn’t know why I was laughing so hard, but she half laughed with me and half, knowing that I was laughing at her, whined at me for laughing. She was just so transparent that she didn’t need any diaper or rash cream, but she was really hoping to have the tube to play with. Combined with her calling it sour cream, it was too much for me.
 
It’s a wonder that D and I still seek to pay a babysitter and go out for theater when we get so much entertainment at home!
