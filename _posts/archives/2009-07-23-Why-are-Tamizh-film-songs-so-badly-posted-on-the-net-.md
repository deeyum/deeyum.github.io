I wanted to get the song, "kaNNan varuvAn kathai solluvAn" from the movie "PanchavarNa kiLi", on the net. No luck. All I get are interminably boring conversations between some vague music fans..when I try the YouTube, I got this:

<a href="http://www.techsatish.net/2008/01/25/kannan-varuvan-kathai-solluvan-panjavarnakilli-tamil-movie-song/"> this video has been removed due to terms of use violation </a>.

This is the case with many, many songs. Why are we incapable of uploading our songs properly to YouTube, and posting the lyrics neatly somewhere online? 

I can't even get the lyrics for this song anywhere. (If anyone would write them for me I would be full of grate.)

We write code for the rest of the world, but our personal housekeeping is shoddy, to say the least!
