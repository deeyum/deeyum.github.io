Q. What are Jokkus?

A. In the old days of travelling "tent" cinemas, Tamizh  people had a politically very incorrect crack about Kannadigas. It was said that a comedy sequence would be shown on the screen, and the Kannadiga audience would watch stoically. Following this, a sub-title would be flashed: "Ithu Jokku" (This Is A Joke). The audience would then laugh.

I'm sorry, that's what I heard, growing up...so I am retailing it here!

Here are some old, and some new (at least, to me), PIJ (Politically Incorrect Jokkus) that I got on an internet forward....

If there are any non-Indian friends who are reading this....there are too many contexts to explain, so just enjoy the ones you do understand!

Dear Baba Ramdev, we can't ban 1000 & 500 rupee notes. We are a secular country. So we need to respect all denominations.

A documentary on Air India's planes  Saare Zameen Par.

All MPs to get iPads. Awesome. As some would say, from anPad to iPad in 3 days.
