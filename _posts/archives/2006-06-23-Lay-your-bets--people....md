I got this amusing forward....what are they going to do later, when the  (3954 minus World Cup Year) equation starts giving years when the World Cup didn't exist?

Oh, well, like the petroleum crunch, we'll let that problem take care of itself in the future...meanwhile, let's call the bookie right now!

And <LJ user="oldhen"> has this to say:

I got this forward if I remember rightly around the'98 world cup.. Not to nitpick - but it clearly didn't work for 1998 when France won its first world cup (England won in '66). 







THE 2006 FIFA WORLD CUP WINNER is....





<FONT face=Arial><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Brazil</FONT> </STRONG>won the world cup in 1994. Before that,&nbsp;<SPAN class=785051603-23062006><FONT color=#0000ff>&nbsp;th</FONT></SPAN>e<SPAN class=785051603-23062006><FONT color=#0000ff>y&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN> had won this title for
the last time in 1970.

If you add up: 1970 + 1994 = 3964

<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Argentina</FONT></STRONG> won the world cup for the last time in 1986. Before that only
in 1978.

And 1978 + 1986 = 3964

<STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff>Germany</FONT></STRONG>, though, won the world cup in 1990. Before that, Germany won in
1974.

Look: 1990 + 1974 = 3964

This could lead us to guess the winner of the World Cup in 2002, since
it should be the winner of the 1962 World Cup (In fact 3964 - 2002 =
1962).
</FONT></DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial>And Brazil won the world cup in 1962! (And, in fact, Brazil won the 2002
WC)

This numerology seems to work ...

And now, who would be the winner of the 2006 world cup?
Let's see, 3964 - 2006 = 1958

And who won in 1958? . . .

<FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Oh, <STRONG>Brazil </STRONG>did!!!
