Been gallivanting as usual....Lalbagh on the 25th morning, to Gulakmale on  the 26th, to Bannerghatta JLR on the 27th, to volunteer with 48 children from Vidya Niketan, Bangalore.... it's been a wonderful time.

Here is an image of a push-cart seller from Lalbagh:

And this one, with a shaft of sunlight:

On the night of the 25th, I also went to "Yamini", an all-night music and dance festival at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. Here's  a photograph of light percolating through the smoke of the mosquito-repellents:

In the dark, I got the colours of this Bougainvillea because of some back-lighting:

I enjoy colours very much...and unexpected effects on my MLC!
