The 6th was <LJ user="anushsh">'s birthday (I am terrible at remebering to wish people on my LJ, and this absolutely rotten internet connection is NOT helping!) and we took him out to dinner at <a href="http://bangalore.burrp.com/establishment/view/186259948"> Kamat Bugle Rock </a>. The food was not as good as usual, though the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharwad"> jolada rotis </a> that originate in Dharwad were soft and delicious.

Here are Anush, me, Pavitra and KM at KBR:

Let me close this and post it before my internet connection decides to act up!
