Rush,rush, rush...
Around me, the seconds flow past
The minutes fly
The hours march,
The months creep slowly.
I hardly feel the year's progress
Into the lap of what-has-been.
I live in the present...
That's a conondrum
As with every ticking second
My present becomes the past.
As I sit here, writing,
My heart starts the next beat.
I take my next breath.
I am not what I was
When I first thought of  writing this.
What a relentless river Time is.
