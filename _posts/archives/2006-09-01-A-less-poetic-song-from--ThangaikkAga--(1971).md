Have been posting about all the&nbsp; beautiful, poetic Tamizh songs...well, here's&nbsp; part of one of the other type:

The song is "angamuthu thangamuthu thaNNikku pOnALAm" with Nagesh and cohorts.....one of whom is a male dressed as a woman....

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Operation illAmalEy AmbaLai pombaLai AnA - co-</FONT></DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>operation thEdikittu kOdambAkkam pOnA...</FONT></DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Corporation Lorry...oNNu kattiyirukkuthu sAri...</FONT></DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Ashai konjam meeri...iva Aru mAsam carry...oh bailabailabaila...etc


Translation: 

Without any operation, a man became a woman; 
looking for co-operation, she went to Kodambakkam (an area of Chennai famous for both the cinema studios and the red light district..you take your pick!);
here is a Corporation Lorry (the city corporation uses the most decrepit lorries for garbage clearance)
wearing a sari;
but desire overflowed..
and she is six months "carrying"....

So we can produce crapola stuff too...! I don't know whether to laugh, or to cringe!</FONT></DIV>
