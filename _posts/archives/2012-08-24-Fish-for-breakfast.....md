The Brahminy Kite
Has a head that is white
The rest of it is a lovely red-brown;
He sat for an hour, at least,
With this fish for a feast,
As he pecked and gulped it all down!

Been having a very hard time, and also fell ill with viral fever (I rarely fall ill, and can't believe it when I do!)...am off to Masinagudi for the weekend, but hope I will be regular hereafter...even though LJ is snowing me under with spam...

Veena, this post is especially for you..I'm so glad you missed me!
