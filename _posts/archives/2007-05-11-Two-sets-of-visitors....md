I had two sets of visitors today...<LJ user="anushsh"> and <LJ user="amonks">; and then, later on <LJ user="vyshnavi"> and <LJ user="ti22">. I enjoyed myself very thoroughly today, I must say!

With the first two, I visited Madivala Lake once more, and here are a few pictures....

Here's a garden lizard, basking in the sun; I am afraid some boys were very keen on helping us with the photography and soon chased it off:

Here's an Ashy Prinia, singing away:

An assortment of cormorants (that sounds good, doesn't it?) sunning themselves:

Here's a harmless rat snake which had been caught and killed by some boys:

Well, I did have one other problem today, but will post later about that...I did enjoy my trip to Madivala Lake, though, and it felt good to aim and shoot at wild creatures again! Thank you, <LJ user="anushsh"> and <LJ user="amonks">!
