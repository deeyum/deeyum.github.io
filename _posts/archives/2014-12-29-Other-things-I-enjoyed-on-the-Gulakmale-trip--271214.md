As we climbed to the tank bund, I saw these puppies rolling around in the gutter. They were squealing and rolling around! One looked up at me curiously as I clicked.

It was very funny to see four boys trying to ride on a cycle; as they turned the bend, the chain on the cycle came off!

Loved the Plumeria (Frangipani) flowers, against the sky:

The Marsh Glory (Ipomaeia sp.) is a plant that grows wild, but the flowers are beautiful!

I noticed these ants farming their aphids on the grass stalks.

I decided to take a close up of a beehive...it was, literally, swarming with them!

As we returned home I took the snap of the two gopuras of the Champakadhama temple at Bannerghatta.

As we had breakfast at a darshini (Prabha Upahara) at Bannerghatta Circle, I noticed this monkey with some bright fabric. For some reason, other monkeys wanted it too, and a lively fight ensued! Talk about monkey business!
