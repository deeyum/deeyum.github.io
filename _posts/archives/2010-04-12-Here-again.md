Almost exactly a year ago, I made

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/525275.html?thread=3598299"> this post </a>

about a Canada goose nesting right opposite the entrance to the St.Louis Hindu temple.

Well, we went last week...and either she herself, or one of her sisters (the former being far more likely) is back again!

It cheered me immensely that this bird thinks this is a safe nesting spot!
