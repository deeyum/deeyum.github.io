and saw  so many noble trees....peepul,jamun,tamarind,rain trees, copper pods,travellers' palms...but it was also sad to think that our short-sighted government cannot think of any solution to the traffic problems but felling the trees and  broadening the roads...a very short-term measure as long as the number of cars on the road are not regulated, and the number of vehicles being registered and released on to the roads are also not restricted.

Here's an ex-mango tree, which must have been 50 years old...

Tomorrow we take our huntin'-shootin'-fishin' guest to Galibore, to show him a forest and a river where huntin', shootin' and fishin' (except for catch-and-release) are NOT permitted!

However, because of his interests, our guest is excellent at spotting birds...so he's going to be a great help in whatever photography KM and I do tomorrow!

Have a great Sunday, everyone...I love my life and I wish everyone were as happy as I am...
