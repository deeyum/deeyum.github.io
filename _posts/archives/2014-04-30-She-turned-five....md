Yesterday, April 29th, was the day Eli/Biddli/Boodi Ma/Beedool turned five.

She loves dressing up and is quite the girly girl. Her especial favourites are "sparkly shoes"...she seems to have got a new pair for this birthday!

Her paternal grandparents were there to wish her and cherish her...well, I can't complain, I'll be there, too, in the course of time!

Happy birthday, my dear angel fairy, may magic dust touch you all your life.
