...and they are not "+" and "-"!

First I see this:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5178.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5178.jpg" border="0" alt="bad attitude sign 130510"></a>

and then I see this sign, which is FULL of attitude!

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_5177.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5177.jpg" border="0" alt="I don't like mondays gun sign 130510"></a>

Oh, perhaps I shouldn't mention it....that gun in the sign is out for a target...
