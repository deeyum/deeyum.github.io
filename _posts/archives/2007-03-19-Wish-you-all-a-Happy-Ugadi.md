Well...I couldn't get a really good picture of the Karnataka State Bird, the Indian Roller...but thought I would post this picture of the lovely, common bird, the Green Bee Eater...

May Ugadi be as beautiful as this bird, and may the coming year be as full of colour and happiness!

Tamil New Year falls nearly a month after the Kannada New Year (that will be on April 14th)..so that will give me another opportunity to make a wish-post!
