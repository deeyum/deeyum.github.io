Can any techie tell me why, though I have not edited my tag settings, since Nov 28th, my tag entries are not showing on my LJ posts? When I go to edit the entries, there they are, the sweet little things, all nestled up in their nice Tag Box, but the shy creatures are refusing to show themselves on my LJ page....can anyone yank the curtain of ignorance from my meagre understanding and tell me what I should do to make those critters co-operate as usual?

I tried the FAQ's but that didn't help, and have got no answer from the tech support either....

The commas that represent the tags show up on the preview, too.

I have put 3 tags for this post, "tags", "LJ posts", and "not showing"....I think the last one will be true.

I just checked..the tags are not working, either.

HELP!
