On my walk, I saw this bird, and photographed it:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23073985@N08/2232867666/" title="un id goose jefferson lake forest park 300108 by stlouisvisit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2033/2232867666_a56bf78b59_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="un id goose jefferson lake forest park 300108" /></a>


And when I came home, I could not get any sort of match for its id. So I googled and got the name of <a href="http://webster.edu/~corbetre/birds/park-bird-photos.html"> Bob Corbett </a>, a birder who lives near Forest Park, too, and here's what he had to say:


"this is a legendary bird that hangs around the lake near the boat house.
It is legendary since it and its off spring have been there for a few years
and cause every bird watcher to flip, wondering what in the world it is.

"It turns out the experts who work with the park tells us it is a domestic
bird that was turned loose by it's owner and it not a special breed, but a
specially bred bird that doesn't look like any other.

"I did the same thing.  First time I saw it I hurried over to the visitor's
center to talk to the Missouri Conservation agent there to ask about the bird
and she had a big laugh with me telling me how many people come to ask."


What a bird it is...looks like a cross between a goose and a turkey!


And....I have a question for <LJ user="joylita"> and <LJ user="asakiyume">. I was taught to use a fresh 'open quote' mark at the beginning of every new paragraph, when writing a quote down...do you know if this practice is still followed?
