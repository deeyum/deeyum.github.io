Let me start with the disclaimer. I was made to realize that these photographs are not "technically" good; the fuzziness of the beating of the wingtips apparently spoils the photograph and it is not worth printing or otherwise displaying....but that's to a perfectionist.

To me, it's different. Firstly, that's the Southern Birdwing, one of the largest butterflies in this region. I do not know when I will ever get an opportunity of photographing it again. This is the first time I have seen it.

And then, the fact that even in a photograph like this, the wingtips are still quivering fast enough no make that "fuzzy" effect, shows the speed at which the butterfly's wings must be beating....what a delicate creature,and what a metabolic rate it must have! To me, it is an example of life at its quickest...so here's presenting the Southern Birdwing, on a bract of bougainvillea.

Here's another view of this beauty:

The wingtips are still quivering away!

But here, in a somewhat larger perspective, the creature seems more at rest:

I think that I shall never be good enough to post pictures to forums like India Nature Watch....but on my own LJ, I can enjoy myself without worrying about my level of perfection or otherwise!
