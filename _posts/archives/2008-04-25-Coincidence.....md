When I was in St Louis, I would, once in a while, buy the New York Times newspaper and bring it home. Once, when I did this, and was reading it, I came across an article on migrant birds being  possible carriers of the Avian flu...and there was a picture of BAR-HEADED GEESE  which was credited to <a href="http://buddingbirds.blogspot.com/">  M.Niranjan </a> , who was not mentioned by name in the article.

I mailed Niri (I met him through the JLRNTP) at once, and it was very nice when he came home with Deepak to collect the newspaper.

The coincidence?

When a few of us had gone to Devarayanadurga, the TV Channel, "Kasturi", had taped an interview with some of us (<LJ user="anirudhc">, <LJ user="mamtanaidu">, and Seshadri) and asked me to say what we were doing in the place, and to request for a hit Kannada song. Of course I requested a song from "Mungaru Male"!

And last Saturday, when I was sitting near my front gate, idly photographing the Brahminy Kite and wondering when I would get back in my flat, being locked out...Niri phoned and told me that he had just switched on the TV, and I was on the air with my friends, asking for the song! "Quick, quick, switch on the TV!" he said. I told him that I was giving our security guards some company for a while!

How funny that when one person has something to do with the media, the other person spots it, and it works in reverse, too!
