I wanted to post this yesterday, but today will do. 

Exactly a year ago, this is what KTB, alias my GD, looked like:

And several years ago, that's her mother, along with HER mother, and her mother's family:

It doesn't feel like it when you are dealing with the daily chores of bringing up a baby...but they grow up SO fast!
