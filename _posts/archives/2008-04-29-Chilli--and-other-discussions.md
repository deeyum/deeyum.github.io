I felt really bad when <LJ user="debbieann"> and <LJ user="charleshaynes"> rather suddenly pulled up their stuff and left Bangalore; I was, of course, able to keep in touch with them through their LJ's, but when I realized they were going to be back in Bangalore for a few days, I was very keen to go and meet them. So there was also <LJ user="udhay">, <LJ user="themadman"> and <a href="http://www.aadisht.net/"> Aadisht </a> , whose LJ username I just cannot remember, even though I had no alcohol...but that's OK, since he seems far more active on Blogger. I also met <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bijuchacko"> Biju </a>, and exchanged notes with <a href="http://www.svaksha.com/"> Vidya </a>.

Conversation started with, and kept touching on, the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071026162420.htm"> Bhut Jolokia </a>, which <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Gautam_John/663905117"> Gautam </a> had brought from a friend's restaurant, in pounded/ground form. The smell of it (not too close with those nostrils!) when the little dabba was opened was heavenly; and Charles added it, a teeny bit at a time, to a small glass of vodka, and the experiment was, probably, to see at what point of time steam appeared out of the taster's ears... Charles had also brought along some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Savina_pepper"> Red Savina habanero pepper </a>,but this was cut down and "tempered" with onions and ground.

I wonder if there are specific names for all the chilis I scoop up in the local market? I am sure,but there is no consistency in what I get and I settle for the what I can get. In general, the rule seems to be "the smaller, the deadlier"....I wonder if anyone can throw light on these chillies.

And while talking to Aadisht, I did wish, once again,that I had been on the <a href="http://skthewimp.livejournal.com/177943.html"> Bangalore Photowalk </a>, which I missed, alas, due to the Bandipur trip...seems to have been a great outing. Good going, <LJ user="skthewimp">...am going to join you next time.

The economics of running a restaurant, and pricing dishes, were also talked about, and Madhu convincingly proved that Darshinis operate on a higher profit margin than he does, appearances to the contrary!

There was also a conversation on age, and feeling old. As, easily, the oldest person present, the only point I made was that if one's health was good, age was indeed in the mind. But it tickles me that age is always with a negative connotation, and as one who can say so with authority, that is not true unless one suffers from ossification of either body or mind. Every age that I have passed through has had its difficulties and compensations, and I would not exchange each for anything. But I guess, different strokes for different folks...but was I really so afraid of getting older as  some of those present seemed to be? I think not...


PS. The rice noodles I had were really excellent. Though it may be causing Madhu a lot of effort, I am happy that <a href="http://www.shiokfood.com/"> Shiok </a> is moving *somewhat* closer....
