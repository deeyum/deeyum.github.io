In several years of visiting the Valley School area, I've passed this abandoned house so many times...but it was only yesterday, when we did "waiting" birding instead of "walking" birding, and when Mark went into the house to explore, that I also decided to walk around and in it.

I do not know for whom this house was built. It seems a roomy, spacious house. The rooms seem to be of gracious proportions. The arches outside the house look lovely:

In fact, with the date palms they give a slightly Islamic look:

Were these sheds, next to the huge banyan tree, meant as outhouses? They also lie abandoned:

I googled for information, but there is nothing about it. the best guess I can make is that this was built, like the earlier (and now demolished) Art Village,  on property that belonged to the Karnataka Forest Department, and was therefore abandoned.

The windows gape open, with a ghostly look.

And yet, after all these years, the house looks quite inviting:

But the only residents there today are the various insects and rodents, and the nests of the swifts in the eaves of the roof. Oh, abandoned house...what is your history? With what hopes and aspirations were you built, and with what frustrations and sorrow were you left, with the construction nearing completion, to deteriorate on your own....with such good quality of construction that today, many years later, many of the panes of glass in your windows are unbroken, and the whole aspect is not that of a ruin? What a mystery!
