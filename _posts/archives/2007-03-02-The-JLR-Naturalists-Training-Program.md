Having given the details, here is my take on the program.

 Since the time that <lj user="yathin">, <lj user="kalyan"> and others took the course (at that time it was intense inputs on a  lot of fronts), it has become   birding-specific.  However, Mammals and flora are touched upon, and reptiles or insects are not discussed, too. The program would be of use to someone who is interested in learning the basics of bird-watching. However, what does happen is that the contacts with the other students (many of the people in my batch were committed wildlifers/birders) are quite useful. 

One of the major pluses would be meeting S. Karthikeyan, the Chief Naturalist of Jungle Lodges and Resorts, who will be conducting the course. Karthik has been with WWF for many years before joining JLR. But more than his professional details...his knowledge of Nature is pretty vast. Whenever, in the wildlife trips or gatherings I have attended, there has been a query about some aspect of wildlife, the answer is,usually.... "The best person for that is Karthik."

I started an egroup (still pretty active) for everyone who has taken the program. I am planning to set up an initiative for a Volunteer Program for JLR, so that any of us who have taken the course can help out JLR on a voluntary basis when the need for naturalists is very high.
