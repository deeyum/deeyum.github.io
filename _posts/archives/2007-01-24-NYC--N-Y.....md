This time, we only got to spend a few hours in New York..or to be precise, with our favourite place in NY, Manhattan. Our luggage was booked through (ah, one of the 4 suitcases hasn't come to Bangalore, that's another story, the story of a loooong saga at dawn at Blr airport this morning) so we were free to take the AirTrain to the NYC subway and thence to Manhattan, where a friend's daughter lives practically on Times Square (W. 43rd Street). Then another friend who works close by met us and treated us to dinner at <a href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_York_State/New_York_City-841252/Restaurants-New_York_City-CARMINES-BR-1.html"> Carmine's, an Italian restaurant on Broadway </a>. The food was superb and came in mountainous quanitities(but I was surprised, when googling for it, to come up with several less-than-complimentary reviews too!)...then, in spite of the flurry of snow, we walked around until it was time for us to take the subway back again.


 New York...is SUCH a city....the vibrancy sets up chords in you the minute you step out into Manhattan...it's scary, exciting,awesome, awful, all at once....what a city....well, I suppose I really mean Manhattan, but then, to me, Manhattan will always be the vigorous heart of New York. It sometimes seems to me that New YorK is a law unto itself, different from all the rest of America...and sometimes it seems that it IS typical of America, a melting-pot of everyone and everything, with the strength that only such cross-breeding can produce...
