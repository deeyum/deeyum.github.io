Opening up  a Pandara's Box


&nbsp;A drunk tourist fell into the enclosure of the giant panda, Gu Gu,&nbsp; at Beijing Zoo. The panda then bit him. Then the inebriated tourist bit the panda back. The news item&nbsp; doesn't say what happened to the tourist, but the photograph shows an attendant watching the Panda. I am having a hard time typing this with a straight face. I am wondering...where did the guy find a place on the panda to bite?

Also, tangentially...how do they select names for these pandas?
