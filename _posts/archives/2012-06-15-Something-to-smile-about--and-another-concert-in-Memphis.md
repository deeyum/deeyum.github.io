Don't have much to say, as life is very difficult right now...but when that happens, the best thing is to smile!

If you can't call in dead, be in style:

What happens when the wife asks for a diesel car (diesel is much cheaper in India than petrol) and the husband goes ahead and buys a petrol car, and then the Indian government increases petrol prices by Rs.7.50 paise a litre? The wife orders the licence plates...

Practising for my concert on Saturday at the temple in Memphis, Tennessee...and after having lost my voice completely last week, I don't seem to have found all of it. I tell my voice to sing something, and my voice says, "Oh, yeah?"

You may remember my concert there from

They liked my singing so much that they asked for a repeat this year...I am thrilled!

We are driving to Memphis tomorrow.
