....

By about 5 pm, the shed/shamiana was dismantled and cars started moving on the flyover. I noticed much heavier traffic on the narrower side, coming from Jayanagar (didn't I tell you? This flyover has one narrow road and a broad one, which BDA in its wisdom has done..) towards Bannerghatta....by 7.30 pm, the traffic had backed up heavily, and from 8 pm to 10 pm (that's been my evening work) the traffic has been incredibly congested, with both the approach from the flyover as well as from BTM being completely jammed. After 10 pm, things slowly cleared.

Waiting to see how it's going to be in the coming days...we may have to move.....
