Most traditional village houses have niches on both sides of the front door, where lamps may be set in the evening. Sometimes, 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibhuti">vibhuti </a>
 and 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindoor"> sindoor </a>

 are also kept in them, so that people who are going out can decorate their foreheads as they leave. 

These little niches are usually rather oil- and grime-filled.... but here's one that I snapped on our journey from Chennai to Bangalore, as we stopped for chai:

It was a very, very small house, but it had this artistic touch, in the most unlikely place....it gave me a lot of joy to click that! Will those parrots ever get to eat the fruit that they are eyeing?
