....

I have a collection of howlers collected from various newspapers and mags...anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;who wants to have a look is welcome! And if any of you come across fresh ones...do send them to me or let me know about them. I would love to add to my collection...one of my latest is a headline from the Deccan Herald that says, "CM signature forgerer caught". Amongst my favourites: "AIDS patient in Madras General Hospital Stable" (poor guy, probably died of horse-induced tetanus!) ; "Topless Posts in Chengalpattu District" (great entertainment for the people of the area) , and "BJP To Back Front Government".
