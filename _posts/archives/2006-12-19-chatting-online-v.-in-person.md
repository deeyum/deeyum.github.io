"Are you around?"
"Oh, you're not to be found..."
The messages play hide-and-seek;
The search comes to an end
When you finally find the friend
And have a conversation mild and meek.

Until smileys were invented
I had a sideways smile...
My anger I vented
In capitals, for a while.

Now IM can capture
Virtually, every emotion
But to  enjoy real-talk rapture
I wish I'd a magic potion.

The fun of sitting together
With food and drink at hand...
Even discussing the weather
Makes it heaven-land....

Nothing beats eye-to-eye
A handshake, a voice...
All the webcams, mikes and other toys
Can't bring the "being there" joys.
