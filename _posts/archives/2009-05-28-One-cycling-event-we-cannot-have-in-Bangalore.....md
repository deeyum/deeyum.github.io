I spotted this poster in the University City Library yesterday:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0971.jpg" border="0" alt="world naked bike ride st L 250509 library"></a>


I can just imagine Ram Muthalik and the rest of the vAnara sEnE on this kind of a ride....!
