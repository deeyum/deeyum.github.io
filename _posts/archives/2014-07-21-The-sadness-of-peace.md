There is a peace
At the beginning,
Before things happen;
The peace of the not-yet.
There is a peace while in the centre of action,
The peace that takes a break
In the middle of the whirlwind.
There is, too, the peace
That is the aftermath of war
And toil, and struggle:
This peace is not always happy.
This may be the peace of death, of regrets
Of waste, of what might have been.
Is this sad peace, the deteritus of destruction,
Always welcome? Is peace always better than war?
Peace...without serenity, without prosperity
Is just the cessation of foul acts
Without the hope of its continuance.
Peace can often be
Tears in a widow's eye
A maimed limb,
The passing of what was good and happy
In a life lived just a while ago.
Peace can the quietness
Of the broken body of a girl,
Mauled bestially, and left to bleed.
Peace can be the loneliness 
In a home when one partner has walked out.
Peace can be the quite of a crash site
Where people are looking for bodies.
Peace...not welcome when it's just a piece
Of conflict, pain and sorrow.
