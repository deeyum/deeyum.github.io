Recipe for sour lady finger curry: 
1). 200 grams lady finger, washed and chopped into small slices.
2). Half an onion - finely chopped
3). 5-7 pieces of Kokum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcinia_indica) soaked in warm water. You can add more kokum depending on how sour you want the curry to be. I usually like it very, very sour. 
4). 2 tbsp rice flour
5). 1 tsp red chilli powder
6). 1/4 tsp turmeric 
7). 2 tsp coriander and jeera powder
. Green masala made with coriander leaves, ginger, garlic, green chillies and jeera. About 3 tbsp of green masala.
9). Salt to taste

Preparation: Fry lady finger in hot oil until cooked well. Add chopped onion to the lady finger and fry till onions turn transparent. Add green masala and all the spices, and cook well. Ensure that the lady finger, onion and masala are all well cooked. Add soaked kokum to the preparation with the water. Add water depending on how much curry you want. Mix rice flour in warm water and make a thick paste. Add the paste to the curry, and cook on slow flame. Cover the pan with lid. Let the flavours blend as much as possible. The rice flour will thicken the curry. Keep stirring the curry slowly to avoid sticking on the bottom of the pan. Finally, add salt to taste and serve curry with hot yellow masoor dal khichdi.
