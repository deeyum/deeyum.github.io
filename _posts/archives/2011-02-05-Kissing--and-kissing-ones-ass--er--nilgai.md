It WAS a Photobucket problem, not a problem of this little tablet...and today Photobucket is working well...so, let me start with the Bharatpur images. 

I got this delightful scene of a kiss:

and I also saw this Nilgai stag apparently kissing ass:

Well, the second pic is one that portrays the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response"> Flehmen response </a>

a behaviour, which, as the Wiki says, " allows animals to detect scents, for example from urine, of other members of their species or clues to the presence of prey. Flehming allows the animals to determine several factors, including the presence or absence of estrus, the physiological state of the animal.."

...but I can't help feeling that in corporations and politics and lots of human interaction, we have a lot of Flehmen Responses, too!
