Someone on a mailing list I belong to sent me this, it's just TOOOOOOO good to be missed

At the front gate of Russell Market in Shivaji Nagar, as we began our walk, were several posters announcing that various notables were celebrating the birthday of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipu_Sultan"> Tipu Sultan </a>...but what took my fancy was this poster:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_3654.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_3654.jpg" border="0" alt="301108 original photo of tipu sultan"></a>



Few people could claim to have the "original photo" of one of the great rulers of the Deccan (which is a corruption of the word "Dakshin", meaning "South").

So...preserve that historic photograph folks, the first one ever taken, before the camera was invented!
