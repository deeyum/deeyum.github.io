In my cousin's car, I found a decoration that I was curious about:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4335.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4335.jpg" border="0" alt="dreamcatcher 240711 ny"></a>


When I asked him about it, he told me that it was an Indian dreamcatcher. That intrigued me, and just now (to avoid the work of unpacking or sorting mail etc) I googled for it, and got 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher"> The Wiki entry about the Dreamcatcher </a>

How lovely is the thought that hanging one above the bed of a child will "catch" the nightmares and prevent the child from being distressed by them! Here's the quotation from American ethnographer

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Densmore"> Frances Densmore </a> : 

"It was said that they "caught any harm that might be in the air as a spider's web catches and holds whatever comes in contact with it."

I wish I could have a Realitycatcher over my bed....I'd be spared a lot of harmful, not-nice reality that I don't want to face! The taxes that I must file, the death of a neighbour, bad health...oh, the Realitycatcher would be saturated soon, I suppose. :)
