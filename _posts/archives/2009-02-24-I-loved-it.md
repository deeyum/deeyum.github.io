From <a href="http://premkudva.livejournal.com/1058236.html"> this post </a> from <lj user="premkudva">:


"Then there is an uncle who tells us that in Cochin they enforce the seat belt rule. And how he was once stopped. And how he said that buses should also have seat belts, and that Cochin with its clogged roads [and max speed of 20 kmph as per him] doesn't require seat belts. All this he delivers to the local constable who has stopped him, in the hope that the constable is able to abolish the seat belt rule. The constable unfortunately is unable to do any such thing. So our high moral ground uncle bribes the constable Rs 100 and drives away."


Read the whole post if you can, I enjoyed it very much! Thanks, Prem.
