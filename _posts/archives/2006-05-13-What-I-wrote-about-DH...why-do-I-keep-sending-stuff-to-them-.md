All my  original (and undecimated) stuff can be found on my Live Journal .... 
 
I pickle it there, and if it smells good after a while I send it to DH who then murder it and publish the corpse.


...I send to them because I don't know where else to send my stuff!!

Tomorrow I will find my work wrapping up masala dosais, protecting  strips of tablets or capsules, being mashed up to make papier maiche figurines...and goodness knows what else....
