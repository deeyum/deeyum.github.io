Remember the post about the Cheetah cubs that I had gone to visit in St Louis Zoo? Here it is, at

When KM visited St Louis last week, I asked him to visit them again, and nothing loath, off he went to the Zoo one afternoon. One of the original four cubs had died even before we had been to see them..but the other three are thriving...Here they are!

ONE!....

And now for the rest of the news....

1. Laptop is back, doing absolutely fine, I am very happy with my "local" repairman who did such a good job for such a reasonable amount.

2. These pics were taken by KM on....MY NEW CAMERA!! Since KM wants to hog the Canon DSLR when we go on any future wildlife trips (a trip of a lifetime is being planned for July)...he and DnA got me a wonderful anniversary gift...a <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/S3IS/S3ISA.HTM"> Canon S3 IS </a>.

With everyone (er, except <LJ user="chirdeepshetty"> and <LJ user="sainath">) telling me that after being used to a DSLR I would not find this very good, I was under the impression that this would be a simple point-and-shoot kind of camera. Far from it. I am still wading through the manual, just trying to identify the features...

And of course, now, even *I* can see the difference between pics taken on the DSLR and this camera; but I did need a lightweight camera to cart about everywhere....and I am thrilled with the S3IS.

I will need a LOT of help from all of you great photographers out there to be able to use this camera properly....
