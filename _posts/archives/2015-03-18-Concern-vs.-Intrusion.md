There seems to be some particular joy in assuming that I will break the medical "rules"after my cataract surgery. and go out/ cook/walk a tightrope....generally, do something before I am cleared for it, and then making judgmental remarks about it, without finding out whether I am allowed to do it or not. (Or, if I say the doctor has cleared it, the reply is, "Doctors will say such things, but you must be careful.")

My eyes are very precious to me and I will not do anything that will jeopardize my vision. The first umpteen times I told myself the remarks are out of concern..but that theory doesn't seem to hold water any more. Please, I don't want to be told how "brave", "foolish", "bold", "headstrong" and "restless" I am. I've been housebound for a week because I don't want to use public transport, though I've been cleared for going out. Please take the effort to find out facts before passing judgement. 

Just TOO many of these unsolicited remarks...are slowly getting under my skin.
