Not everyone is capable of starting a revolution, but sometimes, when one person stands up for a cause, many others identify with him.

One of the moving scenarios about the slave, Sparatacus,occurs  in the movie of the same name ....when  the Roman masters come looking for him and ask, "Who is Spartacus?" so that they may punish  him, each man in the hordes of slaves stands up, saying, "I am Spartacus!"..identifying with the rebel, and confusing the Romans utterly.

The same sense of identifying with someone has occurred recently, all over India....

I hope we continue to identify with Anna Hazare in our actions, as well as in our thoughts.
