In the ellipses of my own making
I live, and thrive.
I cause the ripples around me
As I seek to survive.
My wings can take me far afield
From the reeds of my birth.
But from the sky...down to the water...
For survival...I come down to earth.

Black-winged Stilt at Harohalli kere (lake), Karnataka, 220215.
