Krupakar (a fellow-birder who lives three doors away from me)suddenly sms-ed me at 10.30pm, because he was given an off day for the Ayodhya verdict. (He'll have to slog it out on Saturday.)It was too late to ask anyone else...so off we both went!

The highlight for him was sighting the GOLDEN-FRONTED LEAFBIRD, and this lovely little

We started with the sight of a 

BLACK KITE

high in the sky, taking along nesting material:

We went, as usual, without expectations...but our sightings were varied and wonderful. Everywhere we saw the Spotted Doves, but for once, I wanted to snap a quick image of the

LAUGHING DOVE:

in the area near the JLR Hill-View Restaurant, we saw this

RUFOUS-TAILED LARK:

Krupakar spotted this

ASHY DRONGO

high up on a tree:

 I could report four migrants to

<a href="http://migrantwatch.in/"> Migrant Watch </a>!

We saw both varieties of the 

GIANT WOOD SPIDER

...the red-legged variety

and the regular variety:

I loved the sight of this 

SOCIAL SPIDER WEB

on what I call the "Croc Pond", between the Zoo and the Herbivore Safari area.


An un-id

MOTH looked beautiful in the undergrowth

but there were few butterflies to be seen.

In the crevices of the granite, these tiny, beautiful flowers bloomed:
