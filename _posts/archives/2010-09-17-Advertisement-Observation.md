The more plinky the music in the advertisement (eg the tinkling notes of the piano in a jewellery ad)...the more expensive the product being advertised.

And these "lifestyle" ads....it could be an ad for shampoo, jeans, jewellery, food, vegetable oil, nappies, feminine hygiene, ANYTHING...that abstract, vaseline-brushed soft focus, those richer-than-the-plutocrats homes, the  fair-as-foreigners actors and those cleaner-than-Switzerland locales...they  are all  sort of all-purpose.
