Sitting in Atlanta airport, waiting for my flight to St.Louis...and marvelling at the technology which allows me to be online, communicating with every one...this, when I do not have a proper cord to allow me to recharge my laptop, and when I do not have a mobile phone that works in the US...I used Magic Jack to call up my daughter to say I had touched US soil safely.


And...I seem to have discovered the solution to my insomnia. On different sectors I started watching "Julie and Julia", "500 days of Summer", and other movies..and slept through almost all of them :) I find that if I have my headphones on with some music playing, I tend to sleep well. EVEN in the aircraft seats I get.

Those aircraft seats!!!!!!

On the Paris/Atlanta sector, I chose a seat as the neighbouring seats showed vacant on the Delta site online...so I got a "window" seat without any window, and of course, two ENORMOUS people showed up to pen me into the seat... the 3-seats-together window seats should come with their own toilets....  Delta had actually showed this as a "preferred seat" for SkyMiles members..I wonder WHO would prefer that seat?!

...and  and my opinion has not changed!

Still feeling miserable that a 'close friend' could let me go, when I finally called, without even wishing me a happy journey...but it's receding into the background as the prospect of GD/Biddles shines nearer!

Why are all airport baggage staff so sassy? I rechecked my suitcases after clearing Customs, and asked the person, "Do I need to tell you that the bags are going to St.Louis?" "Me? I know that, because I'm psychic!" he retorted. I then noticed that the tags on my suitcases were intact!
