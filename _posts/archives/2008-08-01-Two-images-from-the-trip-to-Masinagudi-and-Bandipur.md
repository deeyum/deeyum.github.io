I must thank Avinash (a friend from the JLRNTP, and several other voluntary initiatives) for a wonderful day <strike> today </strike> yesterday.


Here's the I of the E...the eye of the elephant:

That's the mother.


And here's the child (remember, for me, <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/tag/bandipur"> Bandipur </a> is *always* a place where I see mother-and-child pairs of all species!)

I was in Bandipur the day after this fellow  was born. Now...I am watching the baby grow up....the cutest little toddler imaginable.

The mother is Jarisha (I don't know how that is spelt.) The son is Krishna.

More images, and an account, especially of Avi's tiger shoes, will follow.
