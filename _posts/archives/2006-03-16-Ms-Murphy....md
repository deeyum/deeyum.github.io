That's me....I wanted to send the URL of a middle of mine (about ribbons, see my earlier posts) published in the Deccan Herald to family members. So I clicked on the URL, which is

http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar102006/editpage152843200639.asp

Click on it and you'll find the title of my middle...and below it, an article, incomplete at that, about "a fellow septuagenarian" who ordered a solar heater with a loan...

Have just written to the person in charge of "Right in the Middle" to correct this...will look at it again next week.
