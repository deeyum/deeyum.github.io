Today I did my usual walk to the Zoo, and decided to spend time in the Insectarium, specifically, in the butterly area...and I managed to get some ...er...nice pictures (that Tamron lens works WELL as a macro lens I must say.) I had such a great time.

The email I sent to the Zoo guest services got an "out-of-office" response, so I talked to someone at the information desk and soon got to meet someone in the Education Dept with my request to see the cheetah cubs. I was told that if Steve Bircher, the curator, ok's my request, I can...wheee!

Came back walking briskly in the cold, through the gloaming (ha, that's a nice old English word for twilight!)...came in thoroughly chilled and am nursing a hot cup of coffee as I type. Life has such simple, unalloyed, great pleasures to offer...

Am still unable to drag and drop from Picasa to the Flickr uploader; will try later tonight, or on Monday.
