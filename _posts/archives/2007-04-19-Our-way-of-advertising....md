In our country, the roads ensure that flat tyres are a regular phenomenon, so we have our own "puncture" repair men, who advertise by nailing up an old tyre to the shady tree under which they operate. They usuall adopt a phonetic method of spelling out the word "puncture"; but in this case, one guy had a serious doubt about whether his first spelling was right, and decided that he would cover his bases.

How many tries -- and  tyres-- is he going to need before spelling "puncture" correctly?
