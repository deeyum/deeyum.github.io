How easy it is to fall OUT of the habit of regular exercise...no matter how long one has been doing one's walk, or workout, or any other form of discipling the body, it is remarkably simple to get out of the habit ....and so diabolically difficult to get back into the habit again once it is broken! Meanwhile, bulges appear, one's jeans and saree blouses tell merciless tales, there is a bloaty feeling of not being light and trim...and yet it is still tough to get back! The mind says, "hey, lardo, get going and on the road!" and the body says, "Hmm....what about from tomorrow?"
