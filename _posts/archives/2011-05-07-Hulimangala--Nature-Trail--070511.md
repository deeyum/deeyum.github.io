<lj-cut text="more about the short outing">

It was wonderful, once again, to walk through the titanic trees and see the peaceful tomb of Paapayya Reddy:

No photograph can do justice to this wonderful area:

I got the sun shining through the leaves of one huge mango tree:

At the small lake, I got the usual mantapa on the other shore:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF7993.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF7993.jpg" border="0" alt="mantapa hlmngla lake 070511"></a>



On several Ficus trees, the figs were growing right on the trunk:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4031.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4031.jpg" border="0" alt="fg hlmngla 070511"></a>

A feather, stuck on a lantana twig, seemed to indicate how fleeting life is:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4041.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4041.jpg" border="0" alt="fthr on stk 070511"></a>

Near the Hulimangala school, in an open field, I saw this little cairn of stones:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF7987.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF7987.jpg" border="0" alt="cairn hlmngla schol 070511"></a>

The only butterfly we saw was this 

BUSH BROWN,

beautifully camouflaged in the dry leaves:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4052.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4052.jpg" border="0" alt="bsh brwn bfrlfy 070511"></a>

It's clearly visible here, but several of us had to look several times before we could spot it!

This cow, belonging to a local farmer, was obviously pissed off at being led by the nose:

The bsnk og yhr lskr  had this lovely tiny flower:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF7998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF7998.jpg" border="0" alt="un id tiny flwr hlmngla 070511"></a>

And on the surface of the water bloomed these tiny, delicate water flowers:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4069.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4069.jpg" border="0" alt="tiny water flowr 070511"></a>


I enjoyed seeing the others photographing, and the light touched them as well as their lenses:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4033.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4033.jpg" border="0" alt="tharang backlit 070511"></a>

I realized that many of the people were NTP members, so I got an informal group photograph!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF7973.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF7973.jpg" border="0" alt="ntp hlmngla 070511"></a>

The bird count was low even for summer (it was 26!) but I managed to get an 


ASHY PRINIA

in the clutter:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4045.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4045.jpg" border="0" alt="ashy prna 070511"></a>


and then, a

PLAIN PRINIA

as well:

A chocolate-and-vanilla

BRAHMINY KITE

soared past:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4079.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4079.jpg" border="0" alt="brny kt 070511"></a>

So did a

BLACK-WINGED KITE

craning its neck to look down at us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4074.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4074.jpg" border="0" alt="blk wngd kt 070511"></a>


the antics of a

RUFOUS TREEPIE

pecking at the trunk of the tree, woodpecker-fashion, had us observing it for a while:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4087-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4087-1.jpg" border="0" alt="rf trpe hlmngla 070511"></a>

As we left, several

CATTLE EGRETS

posed for us in the morning light!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4091.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4091.jpg" border="0" alt="ctl egrt hlmngla 070511"></a>
