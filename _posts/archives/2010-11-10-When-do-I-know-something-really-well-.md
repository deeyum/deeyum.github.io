When I know something, I should be able to explain it, clearly, to a set of people who know nothing about the topic. If I can do so, without talking down to them, yes, I know that topic well.

When I am willing to admit that yes, there may be gaps or mistakes in my knowledge, and am willing to add or correct it, I am better at knowing the topic.

Knowledge without humility...and with the arrogance of "I know it"...is worse than no knowledge at all.

Thanks, PC, for letting me think this thought!
