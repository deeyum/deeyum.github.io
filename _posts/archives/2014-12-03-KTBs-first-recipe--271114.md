While in Florida, KTB's mother says, "she wrote a wonderful recipe at Thanksgiving that I wanted to share. She did this entirely on her own, and we applauded her effort and the whole family got to exclaim. This was her longest single writing effort, and we were thrilled at the confidence level that allowed her to get through a full effort like this, which is a level of focus we havenâ€™t observed before....This translation should help."

By Kavya:
Get the pot. Pat the pot.
Put the batter and mix
the batter. Put caramel apples
And a regular apple in it
And put a little bit of
sugar, then mix it and add
Honey if you want.
