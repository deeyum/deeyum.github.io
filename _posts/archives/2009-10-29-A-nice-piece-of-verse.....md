Where can a man buy a cap for his knee, Or a key to a lock of his hair?
Can his eyes be called an academy Because there are pupils there?


Is the crown of your head where jewels are found? Who travels the bridge of your nose? 
If you wanted to shingle the roof of your mouth, Would you use the nails on your toes?


Can you sit in the shade of the palm of your hand, Or beat on the drum of your ear? 
Can the calf in your leg eat the corn off your toe? Then, why not grow corn on the ear?


Can the crook in your elbow be sent to jail? If so, just what did he do? 
How can you sharpen your shoulder blades? Ill be darned if I know do you?
