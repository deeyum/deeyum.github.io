When I was young, the musical "Sound of Music" captivated my romantic heart, and I soon knew all the songs by heart, even the less known ones:

Lyrics:


(Maria)
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked miserable past
I must have had a moment of truth

For here you are
Standing there
Loving me
Whether or not you should

So somewhere in my youth
Or childhood
I must have done something good

Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

(Captin)
Here you are standing here
Loving me
Whether or not you should

(Maria)
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good

(Together)
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could

(Maria)
So some where in my youth....

(Captain)
or childhood

(Maria)
I must have done something

(together)
Something good



My heart is overjoyed for <lj user="kadambarid">.
