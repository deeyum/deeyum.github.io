I have, for a change, been watching TV (usually I tape a couple of programs like the Tonight Show or Thein KiNNam and watch it at some point, that's all) and had tuned into NDTV...and I feel so bad...a teacher is accused of making a pornographic movie with her students; a child dies because the ambulance is stuck in a traffic jam on the way to hospital; a mob rampages because some youths were killed, and that results in yet another death; and so the gruesome news goes..

NOT being in the news is something I am profoundly thankful for. My life goes on its even tenor; everything is well, and small troubles are just that...small troubles.

I am incredibly lucky to  be a person to whom things DON'T happen. "May you live in interesting times" may, or may not, be a <a href="http://udhay.livejournal.com/24766.html"> Chinese curse </a> but it is a curse nevertheless.

Oh well...here are two pictures from my trip that I really like; the first is sunset on the evening of the 26th, in Kochi, on the backwaters:

Behind the fishing nets, the rain is still coming down...


And the second is the early morning sun from my aircraft window as we flew over the Western Ghats, towards Bengaluru....

Both these are for  <LJ user="asakiyume">, who opened my eyes afresh to the beauty that the sky can bring. (In fact, I think you should change your name to "askyume". OK, O.J --Orrible Joke-- over.)


And...let me mention once again how MUCH I enjoy that Canon S3....!
