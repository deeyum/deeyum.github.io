In Dibru/Shaikowa, we stayed on the banks of a water body called Magori Beel (beel is lake) which connected to the Magori river. As we went around looking at waterbirds, I saw this horse all the time:

Our guide Binanda told us that for some reason, this horse just does not like working and the owner pampers the animal, too! It was lovely watching the animal under that simple shelter...

Here he is, his coat shining in the misty sunlight:

We think being human is the greatest thing in life...but I'd like to be that horse in his house of hay....!
