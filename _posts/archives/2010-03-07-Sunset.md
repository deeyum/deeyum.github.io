The curfew may toll the knell of parting day,
As Gray in his "Elegy" liked to say;
To me the evening hour is not sad, but a time of ease,
The day's work done, I enjoy the peace.

Tomorrow it's going to be the same old story;
But now...the sun sets in a blaze of glory.
I walk...I take respite from the routine...
And drink in the serenity of the scene.
