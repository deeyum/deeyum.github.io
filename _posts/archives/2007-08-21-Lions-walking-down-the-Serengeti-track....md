Here is my short clip of the two adorable lion cubs and the two lioness walking past our safari van, in the Ngorongoro Crater area:

You can hear Huruma, our guide, telling us that one was "hitted by a porcupine"!


For the rest of the videos that I have uploaded  (well, with a lot of help from <lj user="anushsh">) to YouTube,at

There's an olive baboon grooming her mate while the babies run around, there's a mother shrike feeding her little one, a hornbill struggling to swallow the large grasshopper it caught...they are all short clips, and since they are my first attempts at video, that shows, too!

I will be posting a few more soon.
