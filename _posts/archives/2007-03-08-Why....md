Why is it that when I am idle and sitting in front of my laptop, no one seems to post anything..but let me be busy for a day (or even half a day), that's the signal for the friends to post in their hundreds?

And...why do some insurance companies have a condition that if you have claimed insurance for some particular illness or surgery, you cannot claim for it for the next four years, even if you are paying for your premiums? Isn't continued cover for a major illness the whole point of paying high premiums for an insurance policy?

Oh...I am not wishing anyone for Women's Day...I don't really like tokenism...what about the other 364 days? Every day is Mother's Day and Father's Day and Buy An Expensive Card from Hallmark Day...
