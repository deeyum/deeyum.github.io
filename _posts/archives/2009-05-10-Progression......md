First the skies give the signal...


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0060.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0060.jpg" border="0" alt="sun thru clouds 090509"></a>

(Note: this one's for <LJ user="asakiyume"> as usual....it was this morning)

<lj-cut text="what happens next?">


There's an arching need to find a companion:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0046.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0046.jpg" border="0" alt="arch 080509 subash visit"></a>


(Note: I took this when we took our friend Subash for a sight-seeing drive yesterday)


So they go and get paired off....


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0043.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0043.jpg" border="0" alt="wedding grp photo forest park 080509"></a>

(Note: a lot of wedding groups come to have their photographs taken in Forest Park)


Then the Nativity inevitably occurs:



<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0062.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0062.jpg" border="0" alt="nativity st l 090509"></a>

(Note: that's a permanent decoration on a home that I pssed on one of my walks)


And the net result is a disgusted-looking individual:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0037.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0037.jpg" border="0" alt="kavya 1 week old 090509"></a>

(Note: that was yesterday before the drive; K did NOT like that head-bow at all, it was removed very soon!)


And we come to the conclusion...that domesticity is...for the birds!


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_0073-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_0073-1.jpg" border="0" alt="red cardinal 090509"></a>


(Note: I finally managed to spot a RED CARDINAL rather far away, this morning.)

Anyone wants to learn how to connect up totally random photographs? I am going to run a workshop soon....I will call it " Finding the Narrative"!




D's parents have arrived for a visit, it promises to be a hectic weekend.
