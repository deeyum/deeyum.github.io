I was looking for a poem by someone, that I had posted earlier...obviously I hadn't tagged it properly, I couldn't find it.

Well, I typed it into my entry, but meanwhile...

I found that revisiting some of my own verse, and some poetry that I have posted, is most enjoyable! <LJ user="noelladsa"> once said that revisiting what she has written was fun...I must agree, now that I did it.

Must remember to tag THIS entry properly! 

It must be very clear (at least to my women friends) that I am all packed and ready...and the other half is just about getting to it!

Soon my posts will be Out of Africa...
