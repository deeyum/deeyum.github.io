Wonderful song...


<lj-embed id="43"/>



tum itnA jO muskurA rahE hO
kya gham hai jiskO chhupa rahE hO

AnkhOn mEin namee, hansi labOn par
kyA hAl hai...kyA dikhA rahe  hO

ban jAyEngE zehar peetE peetE
yeh ashq jO piyE jA rahE hO

jin zakhmOn kO waqt bhar chalA hai
tum kyOn unhE chhedhE jA rahE hO

rekhAOn kA khEl hai muqaddar
rekhAOn sE mAt khA rahE hO



You are smiling so much...
What sorrow are you hiding?

Moisture in your eyes, smile on your lips
What state are you in, and what state are you displaying?

They will turn to poison, as you swallow them...
These tears that you are drinking

The wounds that time has healed..
Why are you re-opening them?

Destiny is a play of lines;
You are getting defeated by them....


********************


So often, a smile hides a tear...this is such a moving song, and so beautifully set to music, with the simple accompaniment of a guitar.

Watch the movie if you've not seen it. The scene where Shabana Azmi (the wife) pleads with Smita Patil (the mistress) to let her husband go...still gives me goose-bumps. What talented actresses they both are.

When the mistress pleads with the wife to sign the divorce document so that she can marry the man, the wife says, "You are longing for a relationship which can end with one signature, like this...."
