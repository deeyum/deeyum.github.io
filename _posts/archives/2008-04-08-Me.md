This is for <LJ user="shortiyergirl"> who apparently told <LJ user="anushsh"> that I never post pictures of myself on my LJ, and that he should snatch my MLC from me and take a picture and post it.

Why Ashshshsh should be looking like The Incredible Hulk, I don't know. Anyone would think he was preparing to lift heavy weights.


I can take pictures of myself, though, thanks to all the glass that the construction industry is using nowadays (first they use the glass. Then they put in curtains to cut down the light. Then they use air-conditioning to cut down the heat.)


And SIG2...you haven't seen my posts on the <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/226819.html#cutid1">  Suvarna channel recordings </a> , or the <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/93362.html">  concert I gave for <LJ user="wondernoon"> </a> .....or you would have seen my photograph. You need to browse the past....over to you!
