From "The Language Instinct" by Steven Pinker


Beware of heard, a dreadful word
That looks beard and sounds like bird,
And dead: it's said like bed, not bead--
For goodness' sake don't call it "deed"!
Watch out for meat and great and threat
(They rhyme with suite and straight and debt).

Thanks to <LJ user="anushsh"> for lending me this tough-to-read but interesting book!
