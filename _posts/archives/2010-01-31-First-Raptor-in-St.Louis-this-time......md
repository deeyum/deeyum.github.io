I have *thousands* (well, quite a few!) posts to make. Visits to Kolkata, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Thattekkad in Kerala, B R Hills in Karnataka...field trips reports are clamouring to be made, photographs yelling to be uploaded...

The past few days, I've been walking mainly in the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmar_Loop"> Delmar Loop </a> 

area, as I had to visit the Post Office, the Library, the Farmer's Market, and the gas station to buy milk....errands take precedence!

But today, I walked towards the Forest Park area for the first time. I was walking on 

<a href="http://www.roost.com/real-estate/street/MO/St.-Louis/Lindell-Blvd.html"> Lindell Boulevard </a>

Where million-dollar (and up!) homes look out on to the Park...and lo and behold, two

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk"> RED-TAILED HAWKS </a>

sailed past me and landed on a large tree in the park.

However, by the time I crossed the road and approached to train MLC2 on them, one took off again...but here's the other one:

You can see why it's got its name (now, that sentence is a great grammar lesson on when to use "it's" with an apostrophe, and "its" without one!)...these raptors are FAR easier to spot, I must say, in the bare winter branches of the Forest Park trees!

I'm hoping also to see the Kestrel that I saw a lot of, in October....

Well, it's off to bed I go....we'd been to the

<a href="http://www.fabulousfox.com/"> Fox Theatre </a> 

to watch a

 and had earlier belated wedding anniversary dinner with DnA at

<a href="http://www.senthaibistro.com/"> Sen Thai Asian bistro </a>

... a very nice evening....in fact, it's been a lovely Saturday!
