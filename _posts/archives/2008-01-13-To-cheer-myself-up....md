I enjoyed the sight of someone,wrapped warmly in a shawl, soaking up both the morning sunshine and the morning news...there's a sense of leisure that is so pleasing to a layabout like me! His head is shaven, he has probably visited Tirupathi or another temple recently and shorn his locks, whether sparse or abundant; one can see the "nAmam" mark on his forehead...and critically, I would say he has some odoema in his legs, not a healthy sign...!
