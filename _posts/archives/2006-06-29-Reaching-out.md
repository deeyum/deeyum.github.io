I *DO* enjoy reaching out to people, and getting to know them.

The few times that it has turned out not to be worth the effort is miniscule compared to all the times it is rewarding. Most people are, basically, decent human beings (*Cowers, waiting for the flak to descend*.) And I find people interesting...indeed, fascinating.

And out of the numbers of acquaintances arise some close friendships....this, too, happens often enough for it to be worth the effort!
