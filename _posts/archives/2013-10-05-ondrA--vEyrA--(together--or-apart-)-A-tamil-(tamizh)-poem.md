orukkAl, nIyum nAnum
nam iruvarin uravu
needitthu nilaikkAthO?

bhoogOLam. iru kaigaLAl samayathai shuzhattrum gadigAram.
DinathaaL. Nam iruvarin kadamaigaL...
Ivai ellAm nam ethirigaL:
Ivvulagin pazhakka vazhakkangaL kooda.

ivaigaLai thANdi nam
Oruvarukku oruvar kidaitthOm.
AnAl...ivai iniyum vettri adainthu
nammai pirikkalAm:
"nAm" endru illAmal
"nee"yum, "nAn"umAi, thani pAthaigaLil
thanimayil, thaniyAga pOyi vidalAm.


Perhaps, you and I...us...
I wonder...are  we not going to last?
Geography, the two-handed clock that swirls Time around, the calendar,
The duties that we cannot shrug off,
All these are our enemies:
Even the values of the conventional world.

Miraculously, we found each other
In spite of all these;
But they may yet turn victorious
And see us pulled apart:
To be "us", no more,
But "you" and "I"...
Going our separate ways
Solitary...and lonely.


The pitfalls of a relationship unrecognized by, perhaps unknown to, the world, are described here. This could also be docketed in the "You and I" series!
