Can you feel my hand in yours
When we are apart?
When separated by the miles, and worse,
Can you hear my words?
Do they resound in your heart?
If you feel my hand in the touch of the breeze
And my sounds in that of my beloved birds,
Then... our separation will cease...
Our togetherness will start.


I saw this amazing Asakiyume Effect in the sky when a thunderstorm built up over Yosemite....
