Note to myself: When dealing with the Child persona in someone, it is important to take on the Adult persona oneself (cf.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Berne"> Eric Berne </a> ) and not let one's patience or good humour lapse. To lose one's cool is stupid. If there are two children, what can be achieved? When one person is childish, the other person must take extra care.
