Here's another signboard from Hyderabad:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_5024.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_5024.jpg" border="0" alt="frok inscut bracy"></a>


You can get "frock", of course, but some of the others?

<lj-cut text="help here if you are stuck">


A "baba suit" is a set of top and pants for a little boy; it comes from the old Ayahs of the British Raj, who called their little charges "baba".

After the frock comes "inskirt", and "chemise"...

Nighties and panties are fine, but after petticoat comes, could you get that...? Brassiere...!

How nice to have puzzles like this to work out as one moves around the city! :)
