When my son-in-law was here, he noticed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw"> autorickshaws </a> in Bangalore often have other car brand names such as "Volvo" and "Benz" written on them, and also incredibly inflated engine capacities, such as "1000 cc" and "2000 cc". Well, this auto decided that 2000 cc was old hat, and decided to be more modern:

I am waiting for the first 2008 cc autorickshaw on the roads, and hope I have my MLC (Mary's Lamb Camera) with me when I do spot it!

I had done a post on these autos, and the messages they carry,  for Metroblogs at

I do enjoy carting my MLC along as I traverse this wonderful city that I call home!
