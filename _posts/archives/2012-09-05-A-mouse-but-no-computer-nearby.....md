Since I've not totally got back to (ab)normal after my "stag"gering accident, I cancelled my proposed trip to Honey Valley in Coorg...but couldn't keep away from ANY outing altogether, so the UGS (Usual Gang of Suspects) got together, and we went to the Bannerghatta-Kaggalipura Road, wandered along the area where the Waterlily Pond is, and then went to the Pais' farmhouse.

There, in their water tank behind the house, we saw a pair of Fieldmice....

 One was preening itself happily, the other seemed wet and unhappy.

I took more shots of the preening mouse:

Neither of them made any attempt to get out of the concrete tub/sump that they were in...and amazingly, there were no predatory birds around, all the time we were watching the little mouse's personal grooming!

We also saw a scorpion there...but that will be in my next post :)
