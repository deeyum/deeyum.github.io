We certainly had a wonderful time at the Bird Race, and we certainly never had any expectations; our ranking, after all, would depend on how many birds the other teams saw! Here we are, early in the morning:

<lj-cut text="some of the birds that we saw">

Our list had 123 birds, and most of them, I never did photograph. I'm hoping that the others will put up their bird-race photographs up soon! We started at my top favourite birding location, the Bannerghatta Zoo area.

We found several

WIRE=TAILED SWALLOWS

including this juvenile:

<lj user="birdonthewire">,that's a bird on the wire for you!

A bird that I enjoyed seeing was the handsome

LARGE CUCKOO-SHRIKE:

The Zoo area is particularly good, I find, for flycatchers of all kinds. We sighted this

ASIAN BROWN FLYCATCHER:

It's also a good place to get some varieties of waterbirds, at the crocodile pond near the Herbivore Safari:

At the edge of the pond, this

GREY WAGTAIL

hopped along, busily wagging its tail:

a few

LITTLE CORMORANTS

dried their wings after diving for food:

We spent quite a long time watching a pair of

PIED KINGFISHERS

fishing; I managed to get one at rest:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0317.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0317.jpg" border="0" alt="pd kf 150111"></a>

a common bird, the

BLACK KITE

sat upon a pole, eating early breakfast:

the

PADDYFIELD PIPIT

is always a pretty bird to see!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0344.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0344.jpg" border="0" alt="pfppt 150111"></a>

I liked the scenery that included a couple of

RED-WATTLED LAPWINGS:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0369.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0369.jpg" border="0" alt="rw lpwing 150111"></a>


Saandip then suggested that we go to the edge of Jigani Lake, quite close to the Zoo area, and off we went, where we saw this lovely

LONG-TAILED SHRIKE:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0390.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0390.jpg" border="0" alt="lt shrk 150111"></a>


We then went to Ramnagara, where our raptor sightings were wonderful, including this scene of a

SHAHEEN (PEREGRINE) FALCON

high up on the cliffs:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0430.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0430.jpg" border="0" alt="shn flcn rmng 150111"></a>

Though it was the "wrong" time of day, two 

LONG-BILLED VULTURES 

were already on the cliff-face, and two more came sailing in:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0441.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0441.jpg" border="0" alt="lbv landing 150111"></a>


they then proceeded to spread out their wings, we were unable to understand why:

Mani also spotted an

EURASIAN EAGLE OWL

in one of the cliff cavitis...

We spent far longer than we should have, watching these majestic birds...but finally, lunch beckoned, and after a "Thatte Idli" lunch at Bidadi, decided to go  back to the small birds, and went on to our closing venue, Valley School...and we were not disappointed. We sighted this

BOOTED WARBLER:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0467.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0467.jpg" border="0" alt="btd wrblr 150111"></a>

Having run out of time, we decided to head back to the post-race meeting at the Royal Orchid in Manipal Centre, where Prashanth Badrinath (I call him Birdynath!) and Mike Prince were collecting everyone's logbooks prior to getting to work on them:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0496.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0496.jpg" border="0" alt="br judges 150111"></a>

I've put up my photos on Facebook

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/album.php?aid=271770&amp;id=587058877"> here </a>


...we never had any rare-bird sighting, so were hard put to it to designate a Bird of the Day!

However, it was worth noticing at that at 5pm at Valley School, we were already birding by moonight! :)

Let me close with this beautiful view of the main pond in Valley School:

It was a tiring but very satisfying
