You saw the tusker hide and seek...here's a mongoose doing the same thing in Bandipur, checking to see that the humans are going away and not staying back to disturb him

It is SO difficult to photograph an animal which is running across in the undergrowth, though the others managed it with the greatest of ease...I think I was lucky to get this shot!

No post-processing yet...will have to begin one of these days.... as of now, WYSWYG...what you see is what you get, or, rather, what you see is what I got!
