The dentist (or either parent) has apparently told her that she must brush her teeth after dinner, but she's upgraded that to DURING:

Very soon, I expect that instead of using a fork or a spoon, she'll be using specially adapted "broons" or "brorks".... she was alternating between brushing and eating her broccoli, as it was getting stuck in her teeth!
