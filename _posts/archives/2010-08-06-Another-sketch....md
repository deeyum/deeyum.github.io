This one...there's a problem. KM id'd it SO wrongly that I was startled, so I asked another friend to id it...and she too did not id it instantly. Only my Indian friends can id this person (think old-timer,belonging to a famous family)....and tell me what is wrong with the sketch.

A good sketch should be instantly recognizable...both the people who saw this couldn't do that.
