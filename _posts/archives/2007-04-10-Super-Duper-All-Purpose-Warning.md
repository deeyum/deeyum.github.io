Yesterday evening, it was fun being with <LJ user="shortindiangirl">, <LJ user="chaibacca"> and <LJ user="amoghavarsha">..or it would have been, if I hadn't been so infernally sleepy...I went to sleep sitting on (or in) the bean bag, and I don't know when the evening broke up!

And I found this excellent, useful warning, just right for our moralistic thou-shalt-not society, on the wall of the ATM opposite my home....

If only Moses had thought of this, he need not have struggled down from Mount Sinai with two heavy stone tablets!
