Harsha is someone I got to know through <a href="http://www.indianaturewatch.net/"> INW </a> and I have also found him to have a great sense of humour, so we often exchange both images and a few lines of laughter!

So it was nice to see that one of his photographs has been chosen as a Photograph of the Week, but Nature's Best Photography magazine.

Here's the magazine page:

And here's the image:

Lovely image of a raindrop on an Ixora flower. with another image in that raindrop...


Congrats Harsha! I do like it when my friends' talent is recognized.

However, I must say, that in my opinion, the prize only means that he must shell out more cash for the magazine subscription!
