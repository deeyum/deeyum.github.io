I think
I am looking deep within me,
But I never see my faults.
When I think I am overlooking
Someone else's faults,
I am actually
Looking them over carefully...
My sense of superiority vaults;
My criticisms run in a groove...)
I wish I had the ability to see
What could be better in me,
Than to keep looking for ways
That others could improve.

Buttering oneself is so much easier than bettering oneself.
