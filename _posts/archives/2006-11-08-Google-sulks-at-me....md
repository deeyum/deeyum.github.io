<P>...

I had my gmail page open and was chatting to my daughter and to another friend on gtalk at the same time. I saw another friend online too. </P><P>I decided to close the gmail page and concentrate on the chat...and WHAM! all my gtalk windows got closed too, and I can't connect now, though I have the gtalk window open, and I can see who is online, etc.

. I have NO clue why this happened...surely the two are not interconnected? Google shouldn't sulk when I close one application....</P>
