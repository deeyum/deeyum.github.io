On Saturday, I went with fellow volunteers of Kenneth Anderson Nature Society (KANS) to the forests of Uganiyam, to check on four camera traps that have been set there. These cameras have been recording a wealth of wildlife...leopards, tuskers, boars, birds, deer...and I wanted to see Uganiyam, too.

Uganiyam is across the Kaveri, on the Tamil Nadu side, of the river Kaveri. Here are some of the beings we saw....


The

INDIAN ROLLER:

DUNG BEETLES

rolling up cowdung into little balls, that will be put into underground nests, and nourish the young that hatch out of the eggs that the female lays on the dung:

Some lovely

BLACK-HOODED ORIOLES

calling to each other and swooping about:

Two otters playing with each other and fishing, far away in the Kaveri (no photo, I'd left the cameras in the car when we went down to the river!)

A large herd of 

ELEPHANTS

including a giant alpha female, that our jeep literally tip-toed past, without a single photo;


And the highlight of the trip...a lifer for me...this juvenile


WHITE-BELLIED SEA EAGLE

A wonderfully productive day; the others did all the hard work, while I enjoyed myself thoroughly!
