Revenue...that's the name of the game.

Saw this on the back of the seat as we flew back from Delhi to Bangalore yesterday:

Well, at least the title is witty!


Would I advertise in a space where the hapless passenger had to stare at my ad for 2 hours? I don't think so, but obviously, Spicejet, the airline we were flying, believes that people would be influenced...

I am renting out the back and front of my tee-shirts shortly. Why should I *pay* to have Proline or someone else advertise their name when I can hire out the space and *make* money?

You can contact me..actually you need not contact me, just send the money across...
