Because of the rain and high humidity, the fungi and mushrooms were there in a bewildering variety; I am also including the skink and lizard photographs here.

One of the most spectacular ones was this <a href="http://www.azfotos.com/fungi/fungus_pictures.htm"> STINKHORN FUNGUS </a>

I certainly didn't go near it to smell it!

<lj-cut text=" a few more pics here">

I didn't know the id of this one, so I just called it the STAR MUSHROOM!

Similarly, I just call this the UMBRELLA MUSHROOM (anyone who knows the correct id, please let me know, thank you!)

Some of the fungi were as pretty as flowers....

Karthik says that this looks like a SNAKE SKINK (say it three times fast!).... what a beauty it is!

The post of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_blanfordii"> FLYING LIZARD </a> is

Here's the more common CALOTES VERSICOLOR:

But this is the much rarer  FOREST CALOTES (Calotes rouxii)...thanks for the id, Karthik.... with the red head of the breeding season:
