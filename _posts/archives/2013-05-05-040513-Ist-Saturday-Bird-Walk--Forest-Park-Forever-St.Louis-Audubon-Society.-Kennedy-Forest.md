Today's Forest Park Forever/Audubon Society first Saturday bird walk was very rewarding for me. It was great to walk with experienced birders; I saw a variety of Warblers that would otherwise have been Anonymous Brown Jobs! 

I walked from home to the Kennedy Forest; on the way, at the golf course, this 

SONG SPARROW

opened my birding account (apart from the Mockingbirds, the Robins, the waterfowl, and the Grackles, that is!)

A "showy"

SNOWY EGRET

fished hopefully in Des Perek creek:

<lj-cut text="I didn&#39;t get any warblers, they were too active, too high up, and the light was too bad...but you want to see what else I was able to capture?">

As soon as we gathered and started our walk, we came upon the nest of a

COOPER'S HAWK

The Papaya-like leaves that I'd photographed turned out to be May Apple plants, and this week, they were flowering! Here's a

MAY APPLE 

flower:

Amy showed us how she and her team had managed to cultivate a lot of

I loved the colours on these 

FUNGI:

A

DOWNY WOODPECKER

hopped up and down a tree branch, quite close to us:

We came upon a 

CAROLINA WREN

singing, and it was out in the open, not too far off:

Amy Witt, who's in charge of the Kennedy Forest, is very knowledgeable...and very helpful with information, too. I call her the Sibley-rumped Naturalist!

I think that's a neat way to carry a bird book; in India, I can't do it because of the sweat factor!

I've put up photos on a FaceBook album,

A big thank you to Ruth Hartsell, who gave me quite a welcome ride home..this meant I was able to catch  A and KTB and go swimming with them, too, rounding off a perfect morning!
