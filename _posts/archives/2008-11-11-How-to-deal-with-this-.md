If I have any work pending, I get really het up until I have finished it...I am not able to shelve things even when that is the correct thing to do. At the same time, I tend to put off wo rk (especially writing) until the deadline LOOMS dreadfully....

How do I deal with this? 


While you are replying, here's something I liked in Nandi Hills:

That, unfortunately....is ME until a writing deadline catches me by the neck....

Just finished and sent off an article, so feeling relieved and happy..maybe I shouldn't be writing at all.
