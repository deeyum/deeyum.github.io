In the sunshine, the children play.
Cheerful shouts, and innocence.
Adulthood is yet a while away...
Cares and worries, worldly-sense...

But right now, they laugh together,
In the welcome, wintry sun.
I look at them, and wonder whether
They'll look back on this day of fun.

Our immortality is our children.
I'm off to welcome the latest one.
I love children...so then
It's a joy to go to my new grandson.
