As I wandered around, 
Looking for cardinals and hawks
Here are the common plants I found
Amongst the grass and the rocks.

Perhaps soon, some kind soul
Will give them a name;
But even if the whole
Set is unnamed..it's all the same!

So here goes:

These wood-coloured flowers reminded of the lady who sells( sold) dried flowers just opposite Koshy's restaurant....

These are the berries that the mockingbirds feed on...they look so pretty!

And here's a plant that made such a blaze of orange against the afternoon sunshine, I couldn't resist taking a snap.

I will also be posting a lot of pics of plants that I photographed as I walked around in San Marino, LA...they are garden plants, but no less beautiful because of that....
