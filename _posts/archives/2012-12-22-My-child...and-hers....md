When my child sighs
In distant shores...
It brings tears to my eyes.
She misses her child,
But her separation is mild...
A matter of a few hours.

My  child, alas,  is so far away...
I cannot wipe her eyes.
In matters of a  mother's love,
I am not very wise.
My arms ache for my child
Quite as much as hers for her own;
I'd like to rise above
My emotions, and say
I'm practical. But I'm wild...
I'm not missing her alone
But her child as well...
They've both cast a spell
Over my heart....
It's tough...living apart.
