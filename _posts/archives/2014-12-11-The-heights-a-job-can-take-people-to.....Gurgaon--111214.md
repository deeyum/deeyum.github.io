I went for a walk today, and was awed by the size of the highrise buildings all around me in Gurgaon, Haryana...now a suburb of Delhi, the capital.

As I climbed back to my sister-in-law's 19th floor flat (boast, boast...I can do 19 floors after an hour's walk!), it suddenly occurred to me, as I crossed the 7th floor, that I could take a pic of the view from each floor and make it into a movie. So here'the 7th to the 19th floors:

I saw a few garbage collectors doing their jobs on each floor; I didn't photograph them out of sensitivity...I don't think they would have liked it.

While on my walk, I saw this incredibly tall fire-fighting crane:

It belonged to the DLF Firefighting Service (apparently each Phase of this residential complex has one, this is Phase Five)

I imagined a firefighter, high up on that small platform on top, going to the rescue of residents in apartment buildings, quite high up.

Then, I found something that I didn't have to imagine. A speck on the building opposite me caught my eye.

Can you see the window-cleaner?

I zoomed in:

Dangling by that rope (though it seemed a safe piece of equipment, it certainly gave me vertigo), he was busy with his work:

I walked home, musing that those in "high places" in the pursuit of their jobs or careers need not always be the object of our envy. I salute  people like this,  who take up "high-level"  jobs where they live with danger every working day, and take it in their stride.
