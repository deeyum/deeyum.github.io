About 15-odd trees, beautiful rain trees which were just spreading out and thriving, were cut down 3 years or more ago, to make way for the Jayadeva Circle flyover which was going to ease traffic and make a wonderful thing out of Bannerghatta Road. The flyover is yet to be completed and we live close to it, in a mess of dust and diverted traffic.

Since the new cheap, sorry, chief minister took over (his house is deliciously meretricious concoction on the road parallel to the one on which our apartment building stands), work is "proceeding" on the flyover.

This morning, I found that the tree right opposite our balcony, which has provided us with a lovely green view in the morning, is being hacked down. It provided shelter to SO many birds and goodness knows how many squirrels....it was a BEAUTIFUL thing and lifted my spirits each morning.

I am VERY upset. More so because I am helpless. I saw it only after it was hacked irreparably. A few yards ahead, the road will narrow down because of the Mantri Elegance/Shopper's Stop property; so why not spare this tree too? Of course not, hack it down...I can't bear to go to the balcony any more. I know how Dogmatix felt.
