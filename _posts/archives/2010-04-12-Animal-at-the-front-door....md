I've known what 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum">OPOSSUMS </a>

(they also seem to be spelt "oppossums")


are, but this morning, as I opened the front door to go out for my morning walk, one took HIS morning walk down our front path! I immediately recognized it for what it was:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=opossum015.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/opossum015.jpg" border="0" alt="opossum 110410"></a>

The animal really had a fierce-looking face, but for all that, somehow it didn't look threatening at all as it ambled down, and disappeared into the garden of the neighbour opposite. Yet...those fangs...and I was thinking of rodent damage...and googled it up, to find that it

I didn't know, however, that it is these animals that are called 

<a href="http://www.pestworldforkids.org/opossums.html"> Gophers </a>

and that gives me pause, because gophers are supposed to burrow tunnels under the front lawn and generally make gardeners' lives miserable...

So...it is a pest or not? My American friends, let me know...and I wish this one had been scared of me, and "played possum", instead of calmly ambling off!
