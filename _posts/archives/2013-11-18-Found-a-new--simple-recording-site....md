I will no longer be able to record at Muziboo, the site when I had an account and where I had recorded some songs. So I recorded this small song for KTB at Vocaroo:

<lj-embed id="1061"/><br><a href="http://vocaroo.com" style="font-size:xx-small;" title="Vocaroo Voice Recorder">Record music and voice &gt;&gt;</a>


The words are:

Saraswati charaNam
sakala varamum thantharuLuvAy (S)

thAyum nIyE thanthaiyum nIyE
sarva jeeva dayA nidhiyE
uyirum nIye udalum nIye
uyarntha uyarntha umbar dEviyE (S)

ambikai manOhariyE Adi shakthi nIyandrO
nambinOrai kAkkum nalla nAyakiyum nIyandrO
(thAyum nIyeâ€¦.till end)

This was my mother's school prayer song...probably in the 1930's!

I also recorded a few slokA for the children, here:

These are KTB's most-listened-to favourites

Update, I've added the Aaraaro lullaby on 201113:


<lj-embed id="1063"/><br><a href="http://vocaroo.com" style="font-size:xx-small;" title="Vocaroo Voice Recorder">Audio recording and upload &gt;&gt;</a>

I didn't realize there was so much ambient noise that the mike would pick up...will record it again later.
