I have a lovely Toshiba laptop that proved too heavy for KM's travel needs, and I got it when he got himself a lighter one...and for nearly 4 years, it has worked extremely well. This morning, I tried to shut it down when clicking on the Zone Alarm prompt made the screen hang...and that's it. 

But even that has a good side to it...I got to meet a very interesting young man, who came to repair it; he is very interested in wildlife and trekking too, and we chatted and chatted and chatted away!

His blog is at chandanv on Blogger. I am now on a borrowed laptop, so will visit his blog later....
