Here's the tag from <lj user="idahoswede">--

Hah, the difficulty now is, out of the million things about me that are weird...what to choose? Hmmmmm.......


<STRONG>Each player of this game starts with the "6 weird things about you". People who get tagged need to write a blog of their own 6 weird things as well as state this rule clearly. In the end, you need to choose 6 people to be tagged and list their names. Don't forget to leave a comment that says "you are tagged" in their comments and tell them to read your blog.


</STRONG>Hah, the difficulty now is, out of the million things about me that are weird...what to choose? Hmmmmm.......

1.I generally like to eat alone. I like being with people at table, I like to be with them as THEY eat...but when I am with them, I can't even taste what I am eating as I am usually concentrating on the conversation! So I like to eat alone. This is very weird.

2. I canNOT let a telephone ring unanswered.This is a reason why I never used a mobile phone until recently,&nbsp;and&nbsp;not using a mobile phone&nbsp;until recently&nbsp;could also count as weirdness no.3. But no, many people are like that, so

3. I fall asleep ten minutes into any movie or tv program. I have recently started falling asleep at plays, too.&nbsp;I wake up if someone switches off the tv. On those video coaches, I sleep when everyone else watches the movie, and wake up when they go to sleep.

4. I profess to love wildlife, and life in general,&nbsp;but feel NO compunction about killing roaches and mosquitoes.

5. When faced with the imminent prospect of travelling, I wish I didn't have to travel; when faced with the prospect of no travel for a while, I wish I was travelling!

6. I *never* liked having very&nbsp;long hair, ever, always felt it was something that I was doing because of cultural oppression; I love having my hair short, and have to keep a photograph of myself with the sit-on-able hair to prove to my friends, that yes, I have short hair because I want it that way.

OK...

Now I tag
