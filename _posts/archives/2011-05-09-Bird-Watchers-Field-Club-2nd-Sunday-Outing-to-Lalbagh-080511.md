Sometimes one does not have to see many species of birds (or animals or insects) in order to feel very satisfied with a nature outing. And it is fun to meet up with so many like-minded people.

One of the unusual things about this outing was the fact that the people seemed to  split up, spontaneously,  into several groups, and I felt pulled in many directions. Should I go to the lake to see, and perhaps photograph, the Pheasant-tailed Jacanas? Should I go with Krishna and Subbu and listen to the always-new-to-me information that they impart about nature and Lalbagh? Should I go with the large group of people who have taken the NTP (Naturalists' Training Program run by Karthik for JLR)? Should I spend time with people whom I was meeting for the first time, renew my acquaintanceship with others whom I've met just once or twice, or spend time with old friends? Yes, I did manage to do most of what I wanted to do, but if anyone felt I was not spending time with them...I do apologize, it was really not what I wanted to do! I wanted to take <a href=""> Chandan </a> around my beloved Lalbagh but wound up getting separated from him, too, and he apparently had breakfast at a restaurant much better than the usual Kamat :)

Well anyway...let me start with the usual "Lovely sunrise" picture:

It was also a day when I had six separate sightings of Shikras....very highly satisfying! Here's the female 

SHIKRA

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4102.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4102.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

and the male:

<lj-cut text="more from the outing">


Just a little distance away, this little ball of fur caught our eyes:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4113.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4113.jpg" border="0" alt="sqrl bl 080511 lb"></a>

It was a little squirrel...how small must one be, to be able to sleep on a ladder of thorns?


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4115.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4115.jpg" border="0" alt="sqrl slp 080511 lb"></a>


As we watched, the little one woke up, and presumably, avoided being spotted by that Shikra, too!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4118.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4118.jpg" border="0" alt="sq awake 080511"></a>

After we all gathered and started walking, we were treated to the spectacle of this 

GREAT TIT

bringing nesting material and making a home in the pipe....this was the one on which the board saying "Japanese garden" was hung!


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4140.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4140.jpg" border="0" alt="grt tt 080511"></a>


Another excitement was, of course the sighting of not one but three

MOTTLED WOOD OWLS:

who have returned to their favourite haunt, near the enclosure with the statue of Kaveri:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4146.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4146.jpg" border="0" alt="mtld wd owl twigs 080511 lb"></a>


Here's the second one, caught through the clutter of leaves, in the heavy shade:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4153.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4153.jpg" border="0" alt="mtld wd wl tree 080511 lb"></a>

Here's the third one, whom we watched for a while in the Juniper tree:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4164.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4164.jpg" border="0" alt="mwowl jnpr 080511 lb"></a>

I remember, a few years ago, Karthik had identified the 

FLACOURTIA

for me; here it is, in bloom again, with a "regular" bee and a Blue-banded bee on it:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4183.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4183.jpg" border="0" alt="flacourtia blu-bld bee 080511lb"></a>


Having heard of the sighting, how could I not go to the lake? Off we rushed, and were in time to see at least one

PHEASANT-TAILED JACANA:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4197.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4197.jpg" border="0" alt="jcna lnding 080511 lb"></a>


After landing on the lotus leaves, the bird walked about in Jesus Christ-style:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4204.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4204.jpg" border="0" alt="psnt tled jcna 080511"></a>

On the far shore, a 

GREY HERON

stood, looking like a statue:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4211.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4211.jpg" border="0" alt="grey hern 080511"></a>

We also had a tiger sighting in Lalbagh!

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4216.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4216.jpg" border="0" alt="cmn tgr 080511 lb"></a>

And then, how can one leave Lalbagh without a sighting of SSO's (Sainath's Spotted Owlets), as I call them? Here's one;

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4238.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4238.jpg" border="0" alt="spt wlt 2 080511 lb"></a>

And the other, which came out of its nest for us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4221-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4221-1.jpg" border="0" alt="spt owlt 1 080511 lb"></a>


Krishna was rather late in arriving, but, as usual, brought along something very interesting. Here's the seed-growing-on-the-sides-of-the-pod, from the Firmiana colorata, commonly called the 

COLOURED STERCULIA:

 
<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF8036.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF8036.jpg" border="0" alt="mbk with seed-pod lb 080511"></a>

I shot the seed in his fingers:

And he later put it down on the kerb for me to photograph:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4210.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4210.jpg" border="0" alt="pod/seed lb"></a>

A lot of <a href="http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/articles/view/95-environment-wildlife-ready-to-escape-into-the-woods-bangalores-naturalists"> NTP members </a> 

(click there for my article about the program in Citizen Matters) 

had decided, also, to come and meet up at Lalbagh yesterday....we had:

Aditya
Aishwarya
Alexis
Anjali
Deepa
Gopal
Lakshmi
Mamta
Radha
Suma
Tharangini
Uma

It was lovely to meet up with our <a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com"> Guru-G, Karthik </a> ...but I could not get Aishwarya (who was in a hurry) and Tharangini (who, I think was photographing the Mottled Wood Owl) in this "guru-photo", which contains a few other people, as well:

I'll post the proper bird list as soon as I get it!

More photographs and a short account, are on my Facebook page; to see them,

We wound up with a leisurely breakfast at Kamat's restaurant, and a viewing of Karthik's Assam photographs....and met another NTP member, Santosh Martin, and his lovely daughter, Sunayana, too. 

A very satisfying outing to one of my favourite public parks in Bangalore...here's the second Spotted Owlet saying "bye" to you until the next time I visit them!
