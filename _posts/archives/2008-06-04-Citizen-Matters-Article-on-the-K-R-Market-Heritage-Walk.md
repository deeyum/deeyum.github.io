I was just waiting for this article to come out, because I didn't want to put up anything on my LJ on the same topic beforehand.

The article is 

<a href="http://www.citizenmatters.in/articles/view/211-heritage-present-is-commerce-krmarket-"> to be found if you click here </a>

I really like the design of this article, which Meera and Subbu put together for me. I can do more photo/text essays now...I can document my beloved city, warts and all.

Anyone who wants to see more pictures that I took on the heritage walk (how nice, it is not called the hisitage walk! *feminist smile*).... can go to
