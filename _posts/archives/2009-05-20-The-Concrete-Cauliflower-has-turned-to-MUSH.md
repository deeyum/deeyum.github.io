It's awful. Idiotic.

There is this creature at home... that cannot recognize us, who makes vile and disgusting noises ALL the time (yes, even when sleeping), produces the most disgusting by-products...and every now and then, I find myself going to where it's lying, and staring adoringly at it. I cannot begin to imagine that I could have such a goofy expression on my face. The adoration of the Magi does not even come close to the fatuous admiration that I look at this creature with!

And...she's a variety of animals. She luxuriates like a cat; quacks like a duck; grunts like a pig, squirms like a worm, butts her head like a goat (when she's looking for food),kicks like a mule...

Here's the litte Squirmy Wormy's toes, luxuriating and uncurling as she feeds:

That black-and-white thingy is a kind of wigwam that A can wear as she feeds the infant; it's got a kind of stiff vent where she can look in at the baby. Quite convenient, but may be less so as temperatures begin to rise....

Sorry, I *had* promised myself, no more baby pics and posts...I really don't know how they keep getting here.
