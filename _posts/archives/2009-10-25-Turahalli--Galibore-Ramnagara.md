I had a wonderful trip to Turahalli, Galibore and Ramnagara with <LJ user="amoghavarsha">, <lj user="anushsh"> and <LJ user="sharathm">....here they are, shadows in the sunset:

Anush, I must say, was a very reluctant co-tripper...


I find that I seem to have forgotten all the names of the common butterflies that I used to know very well. WHAT is someone with a bad memory supposed to do? It's awful...and a little worrying.

In Tamizh, those earth-moving implements are called "maN vetti" (literally, "cut the earth"). They are in between a hoe and a shovel...wonder what they are called in English? "shoe"? "hovel"?  :) (LJ user="asakiyume">, those Orrible Puns were for you!)

But on a lighter note, what would YOU say about that hen in the window? 


Though not productive in terms of number of bird-sightings, the trip was most enjoyable...even though I slept most of the time that I was in the car, as the jet lag and the strong painkillers I'd taken for the jaw pain joined hands to knock me out!


The sunset was painted in intense colours:
