Does it move?
Kill it!
Does it sting?
Squash it!
Does it grow?
Cut it down!
Done with it?
Throw it out of your window!
Need to go somewhere?
Take the car!
Have some money?
Consume more!

Then, have plastic posters printed, saying, "World Environment Day", with the photos of prominent pols, put it up in a public place, and feel happy that a praiseworthy effort has been taken.
