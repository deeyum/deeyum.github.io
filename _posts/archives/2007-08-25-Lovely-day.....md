Amazingly pleasant weather in Chennai, the company of family at friends for lunch and dinner...we celebrated my brother's 50th birthday...

Is a birthday something to be celebrated or not? KM and I have opposing views on this. *I* think that it is as good an occasion as any to celebrate the fact that one is alive, in good health, and happy...he says that any day is fine,there is no need to celebrate just on birthdays..."Aren't you against World Niece's Husband's Day and other stuff like that?" he counters.

Some people like to mark birthdays, it is a rite of passage..other people like to let time, like a river, flow past without specific milestones. 

But getting together with family IS nice...

Off to Cochin tomorrow, looking forward to being in Kerala during the monsoon....
