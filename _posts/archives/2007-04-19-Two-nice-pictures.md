I do have several, several pictures I need to post to Flickr and to LJ...but am still continously on the run with DnA's shopping and visiting...so I am keeping all that for something to do after they have gone.

But meanwhile, here are two very pleasant pictures from (where else?) Lalbagh...

I often post about the birds...so here are the bees and the flowers (well, flower!) for a change!

And here's a Lavender bush in full bloom; the scent was faint and lovely:

Aren't they lovely!
