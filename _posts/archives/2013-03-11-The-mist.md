This was the scene when I went to drop Boodi Ma at her daycare, a few days ago.

These are the words and  thoughts it brought up in my mind....

How many scenes of life do we miss
Because of the mist and fog?
How many sensitivities lie buried in the mud
Beneath apathy's log?
What do we pretend does not exist
Because we veil our eyes?
How many truths of life do we dodge
With avoidance instead of lies?
