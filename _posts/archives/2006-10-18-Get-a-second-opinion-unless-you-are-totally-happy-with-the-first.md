<P>Brought about by a post from <lj user="premkudva">

KM suffered from a "minor" heart attack at the age of 38,and our cardiologist, though telling us clearly that it was an infarct and not a spasm, told us not to opt for surgery, and that with a change in lifestyle and medication, he would be as right as rain. It is now 20 years (touch wood!) since then. KM runs 7 km a day whenever he can! And I nag at him for his tummy....which has made a reappearance over the years.</P><P>But in retrospect, that infarct made us realize that our lifestyles needed changing. My parents both died of cardiac-related problems, and I am regular in my exercise and diet because of that. And we were fortunate in having such an excellent cardiologist.</P><P>Last year, another friend felt uneasy and went to one hospital where he was told that he must undergo surgery immediately, without even checking out after the angiogram. Because of the knowledge/info I have picked up, I told them NOT to give in to this pressure without a second opinion. Result: we met another cardiologist who agreed that this was a case for angioplasty (minimally invasive as opposed to the major surgery that a bypass would have involved)...3 days later my friend was back at work and his wife was SO relieved. </P><P>So...even if it is a few hours...take another opinion. Of course, each case is different and there are instances when surgery IS the correct option. But...it is important to make an informed decision and not give in to pressure.</P>
I know the anxiety that the spouse and the family go through during these times. If there is a hell on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this.....
