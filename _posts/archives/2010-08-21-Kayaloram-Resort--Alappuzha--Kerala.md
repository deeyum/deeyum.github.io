I do love staying in resorts which have maintained the traditional idiom in architecture. I enjoyed staying at the

<a href="http://www.hotelsinchennaimadras.com/heritage-hotels/sterling-swamimalai-resort.html"> Sterling Heritage Resort </a> in Swamimalai, Tamizh Nadu, a few years ago...the swimming pool in the resort is what would have been the theppa kuLam, or temple tank, in the village agrahAram!

So staying at the 

<a href="http://www.kayaloram.com/"> Kayaloram resort </a> was also very satisfying.

And here is the

 on the door:

It's luxurious inside, too:

Another traditional feature is that while, the, er, amenities are under a roof, the bathing area is open to the sky:

I suppose, in the heavy monsoon season, one just goes and stands there and there's no need to use the shower provided!

Here's the restaurant:

And here are the chef and the maitre=d', Jaimon and Shyma:

This is Raji, who was our masseuse at the Ayurveda cottage, and gave us head and shoulder massages:

That was a lovely place to spend a couple of days, I must say, with the backwaters lapping at the edge of our cottage...
