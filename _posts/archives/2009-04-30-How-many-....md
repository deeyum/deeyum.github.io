How many steps is a walk in the park
When that walk is without a friend?
Without a friend, even a very short walk
Seems tiring and without an end.

How many tears are shed deep inside
When friends have to stay apart?
The outward smiles may be bright and wide
But the tears are in the heart.

How many days can one take the pain
Of not being able to meet?
Each day, one should think, brings one closer again
To the time of meeting...achingly sweet.

How many times must one think and long
For the distant friend's touch?
In every word that's heard, in every sad song...
One misses the other...so much.


This is for two friends who are forced to live on different continents.  With all my love.
