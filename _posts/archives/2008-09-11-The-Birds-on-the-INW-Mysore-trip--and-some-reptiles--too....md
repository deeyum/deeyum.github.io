Non-birding types...off you go.... and bird watchers, if you are looking for rare, uncommon birds...off you go...

Some of the birds we spotted in Mysore; first, at the Karanji Lake, a beautiful water body in Mysore town, right next to the Zoo:

One lone SPOT-BILLED PELICAN was alternately swimming and flying around as if to provide photo ops for the INW members:

One roost seemed to be a favourite; at one time, one could see a DARTER, two CORMORANTS, and the pelican there:

The trees provided roosting places to these OPEN-BILLED STORKS:

The GREY HERON made a lovely pic on the shores of the lake:

There were flocks of BLACK-HEADED IBIS; one is  trying to land in the colony on Karanji lake, I titled this picture "Parking Is Such A Problem In Our Cities Nowadays" on INW!)

On the lawns, a JUNGLE MYNAH was wrestling with its catch:

While in the reeds, this PURPLE MOORHEN became the most photographed Moorhen of Mysore:

A LITTLE GREBE (Dabchick) bobbed around:

Now and then, CORMORANTS would dive in and out of the water:

On the slopes of Chamundi Hills on Sunday morning, with Subhargya Das taking us around, we spotted this GREAT TIT:

An INDIAN ROLLER (the state bird of Karnataka!) showed its flash of blue as it took off:

In the Acacia trees, this INDIAN ROBIN didn't seem too bothered by our presence, as long as we held our distance:

What I spent a lot of time on that lovely, windy, cloudy Sunday morning was this colony of BAYA WEAVERS' nests.


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6965.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6965.jpg" border="0" alt="baya weavers' nests Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

It was lovely to watch flocks of them flying in and out; here's one at the mouth of a nest:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6966.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6966.jpg" border="0" alt="baya weaver at opening of nest Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

One bird was in the act of weaving the nest, very expertly:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6979.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6979.jpg" border="0" alt="baya weaver making nest Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

They would meet and sometimes bicker, and fights sometimes broke out in earnest. Several nests lay dislodged at our feet, and sometimes an egg, too:

(Nest photography is prohibited on INW; for fear of the birds' habitat getting disturbed by other photographers.)


A LAUGHING DOVE (which, according to Garima, is the same as the MOURNING DOVE) went trotting up a slope:

On the way back to Bangalore, we saw this WHITE-BROWED WAGTAIL bobbing about in the paddy field:

The same field had the BLACK-HEADED IBIS, flying off into the wild blue yonder:



<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6907.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6907.jpg" border="0" alt="black-headed ibis flight Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

There was also the BLACK IBIS, with its distinctive red head:

Near it was a RED-WATTLED LAPWING, giving its typical cry:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6998.jpg" border="0" alt="red-wattled lapwing 070908 Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

I also had a sighting of two reptiles I didn't expect; one was this RAT SNAKE, swimming along very fast in Karanji Lake:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6879.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6879.jpg" border="0" alt="rat snake swimming Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

But the great surprise, in an urban lake, was this baby CROCODILE, which lay basking in the evening sun, prompting me to call it...Basker, what else?

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6785.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6785.jpg" border="0" alt="baby croc karanji lake Pictures, Images and Photos"></a>

</lj-cut>


It wasn't shedding crocodile tears, but the baby croc was certainly smiling a crocodile smile, that was lit up by the sunshine!
