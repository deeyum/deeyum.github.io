Just uploading my photographs from San Diego...and I loved this photograph of a gull looking thoughtfully at a flower at La Jolla Cove...

It's been a busy week without a lull...
But the sight of this gull
Looking at the flower
Has the power
To get a smile out of me...when I'm feeling dull!

I've heard of the birds, the bees and the flowers, but this is the first time I saw two of the component parts.

The Harbour Seals, the Brown Pelicans, and the Double-crested Cormorants of La Jolla Cove were just amazing...and after the rains, the trail was a riot of wildflowers, too.

I'm hoping that by tomorrow I can make my post about that short but wonderful walk down the trail...
