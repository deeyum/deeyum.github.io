Got this from Shyamal. I had forgotten how much it made me laugh the first time I read it, so I laughed all over again!


This is an apocryphal tale naturally. The metal bands used for bird ringing in the US once had the address of the Washington Biological Survey, abbreviated:  Wash. Biol. Surv. until the agency received the following letter from an Arkansas camper:
"Dear Sirs:
While camping last week I shot one of your birds. I think it was a crow. I followed the cooking instructions on the leg tag and I want to tell you, it was horrible."
The bands are now marked Fish and Wildlife Service. 

Here's a warbler (possibly BLYTH'S REED WARBLER, possibly not! All those warblers on the bird book pages look exactly alike to me!)
