I do like it when companies describe themselves accurately...

How I would love it if we could see more such company names..."Swindle Portfolio Management" ..."Fraud Chit Fund"... "Just Two Chairs and A Table Dot Com"....

and I think people would STILL put money in them! My friend's son, a lawyer, told us about someone in Bangalore who had replied to one of those "I am sending all my money from Nigeria to your account but I want you to send me $5000 to enable that" emails, and had lost all the money...and was STILL wanting to go to Mumbai to meet the "courier" that he was expecting!
