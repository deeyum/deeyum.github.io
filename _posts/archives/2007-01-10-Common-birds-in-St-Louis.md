I went gallivanting with my camera after my miserable failure to get a good shot of the Cardinal, after which the St Louis baseball team is named. The Tamron lens is a whole new animal and my learning is slow...but yesterday I did get these pictures, and <LJ user="Yathin"> helped me id one which is pretty famous in literature:

That's the Northern Mockingbird (it's common in the South and rare in the north, Yathin says, a perfect reason why it should be called the Northern Mockingbird!

Here it is again...

and again. It has a complex songs and imitates so well that it has been given the name of Mockingbird:

If ANY of you haven't read  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird"> "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, </a>  or haven't seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/">  the movie in which Gregory Peck stars </a> ...you have missed something wonderful, go and get the book and the movie asap.


and here is the American Robin (no, it wasn't robbin' anything, it was just hopping around looking for insects, I guess.)

And here's a Northern Bobwhite, which I found running around the fallen leaves:

Still have a little time to look for the elusive cardinal and get a decent photograph..as I said, every time I go behind one of these feathered fiends (NO mistype there) and am dying without a good snap, my respect for all those bird photographers goes up further into the stratosphere...!
