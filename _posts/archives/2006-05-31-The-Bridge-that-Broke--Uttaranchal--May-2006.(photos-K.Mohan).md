A front and side view of a bridge that had broken down on the alternative route we took from Munsiyari to Thal, via Jauljibi, in Uttaranchal. Luckily for us, a causeway had been opened by roadworkers nearby, otherwise, since the main route was also closed by a landslide 10 km from Munsiyari, we would never have got to our destination, Kausani. It made us ponder over the effort needed to keep the mountain roads in shape.
