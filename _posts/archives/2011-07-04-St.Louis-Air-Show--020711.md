Life has been very hectic...visitors, visiting, travel, a lot of activities over the long (July 4th) weekend... well, one outing I enjoyed very much indeed was to the Air Show on Saturday, though the temperature was over 100 deg F, and felt like 100 deg C, sultry and stifling....

The Air Show started off with a very short appearance by the

We were late at the venue and this aircraft, which I know I will never be able to see anywhere else, was there for a short time, and I just got two quick-as-a-whip shots before it disappeared....

<lj-cut text="more about the Air Show">


It was amazing how quiet it was, and incredible how it appeared to just float along in the air....very ungreen of me to like this wonderful machine, but so it is.

Several aircraft, including the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_F4U_Corsair"> Corsair </a>

then came along and did their aerobatics:

I certainly hope the biplanes had good safety belts:

I must say I felt that the smoke trails at the Bangalore Air Show, with coloured trails, looked better:

But this Sky Pretzel was lovely:

I call this pic "May the fours be with you!"

I also enjoyed seeing the 

<a href=""> Osprey </a>

an aircraft that can keep its propellers vertical to make a VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing):

The F5 thundered past and it was difficult to photograph:

Here are some manouvres I got on video:

I am going to the Air Show again tomorrow (if, like today's fireworks and concert, it doesn't get cancelled due to rain) and hopefully, this time, I'll get better photos of the Stealth Bomber...I've wanted to see it for years, now.
