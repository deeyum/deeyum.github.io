I was sorting and posting the pics of the bald eagles to Flickr, and I came across this picture, which I just loved, for its combination of textures, shapes, and colours...here it is...it's FOG, which is not fog, but Frost On Ground...

The bald eagle pics, less than satisfactory, will be posted in a day or two...
