I don't really remember in time to wish people on my LJ or theirs...but Prem's LJ informs me that it is <LJ user="cyberscorpion">'s budday today.

Happy birthday, CS, and wish you all the best! I have enjoyed so many of your pictures, and miss you a lot on LJ nowadays...I guess you are very busy. Hope Texas is treating you well!

Will think of you as I listen to the CD you so generously gave me, and will listen to some Tamizh poetry, too, and think of you...!
