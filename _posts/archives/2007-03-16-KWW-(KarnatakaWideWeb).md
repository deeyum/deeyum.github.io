Click on this for info about the nest(s) of the <a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com/journal/social-spiders.html"> Social Spiders </a>

That article is by S. Karthikeyan (Karthik), who conducted the Naturalists' Training Program that I attended. He was with the WWF for 17 years; and is very knowledgeable about many apsects of the natural world. He is now the Chief Naturalist of  <a href="http://www.junglelodges.com/"> JLR </a>

And here's the picture....

You can see two of the little critters on top of the nest (it's more like a condo/apartment building!)


Here's another view of their "developing website" in the morning light:

Ah, I did want to collate all that "web info" (mind you, that is just from places just within the state of Karnataka!) Now I can have this for reference...
