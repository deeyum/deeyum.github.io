One tends to think of origami as a purely art form,  for children to learn....and forget the fact that it's very useful in daily life, too. You can take a piece of cardboard, shaped thus:

Fold it so:

Fold it further, so:

Add two handles, and hey presto, you can carry food in it!

I love Bengali "tonga"s, all folding food boxes, and some beautifully folded paper cups, too! Useful origami...
