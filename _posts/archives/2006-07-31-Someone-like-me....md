Here's an interesting blog...she writes very well:

<A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://agelessbonding.blogspot.com/" target=_blank>http://agelessbonding.blogspot<WBR>.com/</A>

Is there some way of adding people on other blogs (apart from LJ) to one's friends list? I wonder....
