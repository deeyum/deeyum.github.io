While in St.Louis, I


<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/552771.html"> walked for ALS </a>


...and later just before leaving, I took part in the

<a href="http://www.walknowforautism.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=304529"> Walk for Autism </a>

on October 10th.

The turnout for this walk was phenomenally large compared to any of the other fund-raising walks I have been participating over the years. Obviously, the problem of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"> autism in children </a>

 strikes a very responsive chord amongst people.

Here's the official tee for the walk:

You can see just how crowded the walk was!

Another worthy cause which I could not join (I had already done an hour and a half of walking in the Park, and was meeting people for breakfast) was on Oct 17, the very next week.

This was the

This walk is to benefit those who  need a "second wind" that a lung transplant can give them.

Here are the details of the walk:

The slogan is, "Every breath counts"...and indeed it does...it's up to us to make each breath count, not only for ourselves, but for those less fortunate than ourselves, in so many different ways.

Such walks help me realize the extreme good fortune that I have in my good health...

Walking for a cause is such a great way of combining exercise, meeting people, and contributing your litte mite to research.
