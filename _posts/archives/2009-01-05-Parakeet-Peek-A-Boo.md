I was looking up at a tree in Kaziranga Eastern range and I swear, a ROSE-RINGED PARAKEET kept playing with me...


There was the empty nest-hole....

and since she did that quite a few times, I thought I would insert a nice notice I spotted in Shillong, on the mudguard of a van, to convey what she probably wanted to say:

And then, there she was:

I did feel that she was playing, and laughing down at me from her cosy nest!
