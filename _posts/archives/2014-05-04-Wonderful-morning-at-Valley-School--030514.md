Thomas Job and his friend Sushil Nahar, who was coming on a birding trail for the first time, picked me up, and off we went, to Valley School.

Several of us walked down the trail together:

Even at the height of summer, birding is an enjoyable actitivy in the early morning!

The path led through this beautiful 

BANYAN TREE:

Here's the tree from a distance:

Another banyan tree which we usually go past:

A peaceful scene of cattle grazing under its shade:

The 

GULMOHAR

is in full bloom everywhere:

Falling around on the plants, the petals look so beautiful:

I loved the sight of this

OLEANDER

everywhere:

In the ruined Art Village, I found this pottery figure, representing Ganesha on one side and Nandi on the other:

There were butterflies, too, like this

We enjoyed the morning, and the brefus at Udupi Banashree, very much indeed!
