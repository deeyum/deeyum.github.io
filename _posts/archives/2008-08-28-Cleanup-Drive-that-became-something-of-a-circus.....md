Alas, 600 people at the cleanup meant:

Dozens of cars (each judge came in his own car,naturally!);

Inexperienced volunteers tearing apart the plastic packets of gloves...and throwing the plastic on the ground!

Several people who were there for the political and photographic mileage;

Arrangements for the breakfast and lunch proving inadequate,and producing a lot of trash, ironically! Some of the volunteers didn't seem to understand if they threw things on the ground, THAT was littering...! 


But...we did need this awareness-raising campaign, and the organizers, and Yahoo, the sponsors, did a great job of getting the local people and the administration involved. 

Now, perhaps, the river of plastic trash that runs down the slopes of Nandi Hills will start drying up....

Had sent several photographs to Citizen Matters, will post the unpublished ones tomorrow.

But here's a pic of a flutterby that I got after I had finished documenting the event:

I think that's a Chocolate Pansy, but (of course) I am not sure.
