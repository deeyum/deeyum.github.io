Though I couldn't quite summon up the energy to put up any kind of Golu for A, we did visit the home of A and M, who are expecting their first child shortly...the golu was really cute!

And here we are...there are TWO "A's mother"s in that pic! (A's parents live very close to her place, and I think it's great to have your family close by on a permanent basis!)

We are supposed to visit someone else today, but they don't seem to be at home...and here, it isn't really Navaratri, it's Weekendratri! :)
