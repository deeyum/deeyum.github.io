Those who are arachnophobic, SKIP!

JLR's Old Magazine House at Ganeshgudi has a bank/tier upon which all the buildings stand. This bank is shored up with mud and stones, with many crevices in them. The crevices are inhabited by all manner of denizens....geckos, scorpions, snakes and worms...and the fearsome-looking

The Tarantulas we saw on our night walk all seemed to be wide awake.

<lj-cut text="want to see more of these?">

They were all at the entrance of their holes, which they seemed to have lined with old leaves and debris.

They were quite sensitive to light, though.They came out only when they judged it safe, otherwise, they would retreat deep into their holes.

Here is one, sitting fearsomely, awaiting something that will become food!

Sometime, abandoned Tarantula nests are taken over by other creatures, such as this

Surely it must have been quite bold to go and try out if the hole was unoccupied or not!

One thing that struck me was the (literally!) silkscreen that the Tarantual weaves over the entrance of the hole....to entrap unwary visitors.

So...when the spider asks the fly, "Will you walk into my parlour?" ...that parlour is furnished with silk curtains...and it's also curtains for the visitor!

I love watching these creatures, but would certainly like to maintain a respectful distance from them!
