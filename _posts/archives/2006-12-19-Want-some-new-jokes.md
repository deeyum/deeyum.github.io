Are there NO new jokes (except topical ones ) left in this world? EVERY joke that I have got in the past few months are ones I have seen before, some more than a decade ago...

Oh please..if you have heard any fresh ones lately (non-veg jokes gleefully accepted) please send them along to me....I am waiting...as the lady said as she tucked into a triple chocolate ice-cream shake.
