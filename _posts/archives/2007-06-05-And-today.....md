"It's World Environment Day!" one of my friends said to me when I met her at her door in the morning. "We must take this seriously, unless each of us is careful, we will spoil the world!"
"Yes," I said.
"Just one minute...let me give the driver the keys....Ramappa, can you take the car to the store at the corner and pick up three eggs? Take the large car, the smaller one has less petrol, I will drop Neeraj in that...these drivers just guzzle the petrol!" she said.
"Yes," I said.
"It says in the paper that we must be really sparing and think green," she said.  "I just drove down and bought some plants from that lovely new nursery in North Bangalore which everyone says has the most exotic plants...aren't they lovely?"
"Yes," I said.
"And we must be careful of water, too...I don't intend watering these plants too often, perhaps that's why the last lot died...and yesterday my maid just left the tap open in the kitchen and I only noticed when I came home in the evening, can you believe it?"
"Yes," I said.
"And I buy vegetables only in that new mall which has come up, they give such lovely plastic bags, too, look, Green'n'Fresh, it's as good as anything you get in the States, isn't it?" she said.
"Yes," I said.
"I asked for a few extra, so that I can use them for other things and have less of waste. It's essential not to waste, isn't it?"
"Yes," I said.
"Muniamma! Just throw those three towels into the washing machine and start it, you can't keep waiting for more clothes!...where was I? Oh, yes, I felt so bad yesterday, having to throw such a lot of leftovers from my dinner party into the dustbin...Muniamma didn't turn up for work and I didn't want to put it all in the fridge. These servants are so unreliable, aren't they?"
"Yes," I said.
"But I'll cut her salary for the days she takes off she's always complaining that her husband beats her...oh, you've got your cycle keys...! It's so dangerous, you know, but you are SO eco-friendly..."
"Yes," I said.
"I couldn't cycle for nuts, especially in this hot weather.I just have to have the air-conditioning on... I really admire you!"
"Yes," I said.
"You are always such an inspiration to me! Oh well, it was nice chatting to you, I have to go in and make sure Muniamma washes the balcony properly...Muniamma, throw a few more buckets of water, and scrub the floor well! And don't forget to spray the pesticide in all the corners...I'll see you later, I have so much to do. Thank goodness we are all so aware of our environment!"
"Yes," I said. "Bye!"

Yes, that lady IS a figment of my imagination, but she is made up of several ladies who do exist...
