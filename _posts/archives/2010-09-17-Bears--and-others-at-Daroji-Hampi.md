The Sloth Bears, of course, are the stars of the Daroji Bear Sanctuary....﻿

﻿There were five bears, altogether, but it was nice to watch this mother and child (remember that's my favourite thing to watch!)

Here is what I call the Rock Theatre at the Daroji viewing point;  you can see the bears, the mongoose, the spurfowl, the doves, the francolins....

And in this video, you can see the typical habitat of the area...and the peacock, too:

At  least two mongooses (mongeese?) wandered in and out of the rock "stage":

the next day, at one of the temples, I found this turtle in the well:

At several places, we also saw these langurs:

Of course, some of the most interesting mammals were the ones I went with....here are three of them, intent on photographing the Yellow-throated Bulbul:

You can see what dedicated birders we are :)

I'm afraid I've been a bit of a turtle, myself, about making this post...
