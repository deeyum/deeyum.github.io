Are the local schools giving you a runaround for your child's admission? At your wit's end about what to do? Fear not!

The only small problem with this school is spelling. As you approach the main gate, the spelling of the school's name changes:

But then, they have a chirpy greeting every morning for the kids..

So...let's be a Step Forward--with Little Harward! (I am sure if they saw this slogan of mine, they would adopt it...)
