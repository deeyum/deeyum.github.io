Two of my friends have lost one of their parents....one in Atlanta lost his mother in Mumbai; and the one in Irvine, Cal, lost her father..she is the youngest of a large family, too.

Both parents did live to a good age...but the loss of a father or mother is really difficult. I was thinking of when I lost my father, suddenly, and my mother, after protracted illness....
