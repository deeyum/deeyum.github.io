Here's a bird that is now plentiful around urban skies; but at Lodhi Gardens, I thought he had caught something and was going to feed, as he flew to a nearby tree.

But then, I realized that he (or she, perhaps?) had some nesting material and was sorting it out preparatory to using it in the nest.

Just look at the bird trying to extract just that right piece....he's very finicky with his soft furnishings at home, is our friend!

And for all that this bird is so common nowadays...isn't he handsome? These birds are also called "pariah" kites....
