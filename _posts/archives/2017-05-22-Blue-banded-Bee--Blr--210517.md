Are those enough B's in the subject title?

As I was walking to my daughter's home, I noticed the 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amegilla_cingulata&quot;"> Blue-banded Bee </a>

(an Australian native that occurs in many other places, too) in my apartment garden,and the beautiful insect cause a delay of half an hour when I decided I'd try and get an image of it in flight.

I've got the bee sitting, earlier:

I tried all kinds of aperture settings  and shutter speeds...but a bridge camera (Canon SX50, see the exif info) has limitations, and I ultimately gave up on the experimentation, being satisfied with what I got!
