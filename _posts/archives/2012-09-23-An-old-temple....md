Nature, to me, doesn't exclude humanity..what's created by humanity, especially in the past, is very fascinating, too. While in the Melagari forests, I went to take a quick look at the old Dabbaguli temple.

The iron girders that hold up the second storey are seen everywhere...

Everywhere, though, Nature is making a comeback:

You can see the two storeys here:

The old arches are so graceful:

Of course, there is the mandatory plaque by politicians...

Here's a closeup of Nandi:

Here's the priest in the new shrine nearby:

Every year, the festival means huge crowds who come and litter the place indescribably...so volunteers from KANS go to clean up, and spread the message of NO LITTER...it's a pity that the same people who seem to revere God seem to have no qualms about littering all of His creation.
