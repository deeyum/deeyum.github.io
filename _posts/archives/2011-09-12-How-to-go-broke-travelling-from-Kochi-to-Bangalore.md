I'd booked a flight on Cleartrip dot com, and they've been reminding me to book my "free" ticket. The reason for those inverted commas was that they said only the base fare was free, and the taxes (which usually amount to 3 or 4 times the base 
fare) was to be paid by me.


The distance between Bangalore and Kochi is, Aunty Google informs me, is 533 km or 331 miles.



But still, I was not prepared for the fares I got when I entered Cochin as the start airport and Bangalore as the destination airport. And the flights were all Bangalore to Cochin, not the other way, as I'd asked for!

Wow, 1.5 lakhs+ to 3 lakhs+ ...I can buy an aircraft at this rate!

I suspect "HKG" is Hong Kong. What a great way to travel from Kochi to Bangalore! I don't know what KIX is, but I certainly got my KIX out of this booking....
