It was bright sunshine in the afternoon, but as I walked down to the department store with my friend, the first couple of clouds moved across the sun:

The massive thunderheads began forming, but they still had their golden lining from the solar light:

Then, behind the water-bearing clouds, the ice-formations started showing, breaking the sunlight into prismatic rainbow colours.

Later on in the evening, it rained heavily..the steady pour of the monsoon rain...clouds are so very beautiful.

I don't have to say to whom this post is dedicated....A-------e! 

Bengali literature is full of descriptions of the beauty of the monsoons....
