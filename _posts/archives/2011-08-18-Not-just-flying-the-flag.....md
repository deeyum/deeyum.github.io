On Independence Day, I found that almost every auto had a Tiranga flying:

But surely, pride in one's country should not just be a matter of flying a flag for one day. If, after flying the flag, I spit (and urinate and defacate)  on the roads, cheat my customers, want (and pay) bribes, try to get ahead at the cost of my fellow-citizens,  and am rude to people...am I really showing my pride for my country, or my contempt for it? Dhould my love for my country not show itself in a constant attempt to keep it clean, observe its laws, and respect its citizens?

Here's the decoration at the Bangalore Club.

In this Club, they won't let men (this restriction is only for men..as illogical as can be!) into the main dining hall without shoes and a shirt or a tee shirt with a collar (no sandals or "sports shoes"!)...and does not allow men into the next-door restaurant if their "sports shoes" are not made of leather. Which century are they living in?

When we take pride in enforcing such idiotic laws...are we proud of being Indian?
