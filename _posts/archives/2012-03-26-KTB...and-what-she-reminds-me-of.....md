KTB recently took part in a march against Cystic Fibrosis, along with the rest of her daycare, Urban Sprouts....here she is (from their newsletter)...

She looks exactly like her dad, and like her Nana-in-Maine, in this.


When I saw this sight, early on Saturday morning, it reminded me of her...

She is a lotus bud, blooming in the sunlight...and that bee hovering attentively...would be the rest of us!
