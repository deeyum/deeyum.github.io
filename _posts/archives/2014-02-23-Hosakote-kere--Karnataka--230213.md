Kamal pinged me past 10pm yesterday...and off we went,early this morning, to Hosakote Kere, with Vasuki, and having picked up Binu on the way, too.

At the MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop).

<lj-cut text="The Hosakote lake outing...">



We stopped at the bund of Hosakote Kere, with the sun still low in the eastern horizon, silhouetting the swallows...

A 

BLACK-WINGED KITE

sub-adult seemed  to have wings of black...and silver...

There were already other photographers at the kere:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716334925/" title="DSC09235 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/12716334925_7e612403f1_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09235"></a>

And we joined them:

The marshy area of the kere was aglow with green algae:

I followed some PLAIN PRINIAS through the bushes:

Several WOOD SANDPIPERS waded around:

It seemed as if this GREATER CORMORANT was lifting its wings in benison:

PHEASANT-TAILED JACANAS strutted their paisley shapes about:

a vee-formation of Cormorants went past:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716564073/" title="DSC09276 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/12716564073_0641edba34_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09276"></a>

At full zoom, my camera caught these two SILVERBILLS on a little pot!

A GREY-BELLLIED CUCKOO delighted us very briefly:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716580673/" title="DSC09281 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/12716580673_3ab4a5d4a1_z.jpg" width="640" height="389" alt="DSC09281"></a>

A GLOSSY IBIS sat in the reeds

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716895734/" title="DSC09287 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/12716895734_d78c08aace_z.jpg" width="640" height="368" alt="DSC09287"></a>


All of a sudden, a huge flock of ducks appeared in the sky, wheeled around, and came to settle in the waters of the kere. We watched, spellbound:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716578813/" title="DSC09279 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/12716578813_c7d5930841_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09279"></a>

Two SPOT-BILLED PELICANS landed, and floated lightly about:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716644373/" title="DSC09296 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2854/12716644373_28f6b4a03c_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09296"></a>

BLACK-WINGED STILTS were in plenty:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716952464/" title="DSC09297 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/12716952464_cc5cbe0124_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09297"></a>

It was a stunning sight when at some mysterious signal they all took off:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716669773/" title="DSC09306 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/12716669773_0f1f79ba69_z.jpg" width="640" height="346" alt="DSC09306"></a>


There were many  LITTLE GREBES:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716654873/" title="DSC09303 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/12716654873_c40de80649_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09303"></a>

A great sighting today by Kamal was of the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reed_Warbler"> GREAT REED WARBLER </a>

in the reeds of the lake. Alas, he could not get a shot.


There were many fishermen on the kere, in plastic coracles (though I saw the traditional bamboo ones on the bank, too.)

The trishool of the Gangamma temple was decorated:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716807454/" title="DSC09248 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/12716807454_e9fca71fc8_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09248"></a>

The temple is the Om of the Goddess!

You can see Shiva sitting with Parvati, with Ganga on his head:

Everywhere, TENT SPIDERS had spun a mist:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12716519843/" title="DSC09255 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/12716519843_2ce26178e2_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC09255"></a>

We took a breakfast break, and went to Sri Krishna Upahar on the main highway:

On the bund, a borewell was being dug, and rice and freshly-caught fish were ready for cooking:

I took two short videos; one, of a shimmering black line of Swallows, and a white line of Egrets:

Another of a  flight of ducks, swirling over the lake, not landing but wheeling around:

Let me close with a pic of this bAginA (offering) that someone had made. A baagina usually contains a packet of arshina (turmeric), kumkum, black bangles, black beads (used in the mangalsutra), a comb, a small mirror, baLe bicchoLe, coconut, blouse piece, dhaanya (cereal), rice, toor dal, green dal, wheat or rava and jaggery cut in a cube form. The baagina is offered in a traditional mora (winnow painted with turmeric).
