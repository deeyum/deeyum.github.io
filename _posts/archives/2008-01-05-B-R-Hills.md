Will be posting about our quick trip to Biligiri Ranganna Hills, Karnataka, but it's late and I am sleepy and I want to share just one image which I really loved..the evening sunlight through various objects makes for such beauty...

We had a fantastic variety of sightings, though, of course, what <lj user="anirudhc"> calls the SIT was nowhere to be seen....but the GAUR, CHITAL, SAMBHAR BARKING DEER, BIRDS, WILD BOAR, LANGUR, and so many other parts of creation had us marvelling afresh!

Good night everybody, see you...= YAAAWWWWNNNN!!=
