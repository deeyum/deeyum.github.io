Now I defy all of you to make sense of that caption (all except <LJ user="shortindiangirl"> and <LJ user="chaibacca"> who are disqualified at the very start.

Hah. Stumped, aren't you? I thought as much.

Well, when I was unpacking the

after getting home, I found one bag had this on one side:

Oh, wow, Supreme Master Television, I thought, *just* what we need. What would this be showing? I looked to see, and was much struck by pictures of praying hens and loving pigs...you think I am joking? ME? Why would I joke about such a thing?

Here they are:

Please note that the bag also advocates heart transplants!

And it goes on to list "life-saving food". Do you know of food which is otherwise (ok, don't count my Death By Chocolate dessert)....?
