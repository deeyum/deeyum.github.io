Since many of the firework displays around St.Louis were cancelled due to the high temperatures and fear of fire, we figured that the display under the Gateway Arch was likely to be immensely crowded. 

Also, given the high level of heat, we were not very keen to go!

So we went to the 19th floor terrace in the apartment building of a friend, Rani Sunder, and settled down there with lots of good food....Couscous uppuma from Rani, Bhel puri and Channa Dal Sundal from Anjana, Milano meringue biscuits bought by Jahnavi. Afreen and Vas also came along.

The fireworks were scheduled to start only at 9.20pm, but before that, on the opposite side, was a great sunset to be watched:

and the slowly dimming skyline to be seen:

How did the sun compare...

with the lights on the terrace walls?

Pretty well, but I liked the sun by itself...

and when it sank,

we turned east towards the Arch:

We ate up all the food...

and then the fireworks began in earnest.

The rising, nearly-full moon added to the beauty of the scene:

And the moon watched the fireworks, too!

Do you want to see my close up of the moon?

We enjoyed not just the Fair St.Louis fireworks at the Arch, but could watch several fireworks in all directions...and came home feeling very happy.

To see all the pics, including a helicopter delivering an ill patient to the St.Louis Children's Hospital,

Hope you enjoyed the fireworks! I've seen firework displays all over the world, but the best I've ever seen was for the Pooram Festival in Kerala. Three solid  hours of scintillation!
