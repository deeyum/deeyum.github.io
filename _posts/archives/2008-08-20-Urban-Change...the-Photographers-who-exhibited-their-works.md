This article was edited....I had made it 1700 words, and now it's 1100....I suppose, from next time, I will keep it to 1200 and make sure the "meat"of the article doesn't get lost. This is a rather wrung-out version of what I wrote....


...and I *still* don't get paid for the photographs...sigh! Well, they ARE a start-up, and they are, at present, on a tight budget....so, I will possess my soul in patience!
