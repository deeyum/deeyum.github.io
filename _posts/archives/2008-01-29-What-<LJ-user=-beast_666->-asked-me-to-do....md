1. Grab the nearest book.
2. Open the book to page 123.
3. Find the fifth sentence.
4. Post the text of the next 4-7 sentences on your LJ along with these instructions.
5. Don't dig for the "coolest" or "most intellectual-sounding" book in your collection. Just pick up whatever is closest.

The book this quote is from is "The Innocent Man" by John Grisham.


The detectives were well known to his audience.

Tommy insisted over and over that he had nothing to do with Denice Haraway, that the real killer were out there laughing at the two stupid boys who confessed and the cops who tricked them into it.

Without the bodyof Denice Haraway, Bill Peterson had an enormous legal challenge. His case consisted of two taped confessions, with absolutely no physical  evidence as a foundation. Indeed, the truth contradicted everything on the tapes, and the confessions  clearly contradicted each other.


"The Innocent Man" is a real-life story of murder and injustice in a small American town...I am reading it because it is by John Grisham. I have only once been seriously disappointed in this author....I detested "Skipping Christmas" (I think that was the name.) An OTT book that felt awful and cheesy.
