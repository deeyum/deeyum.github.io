The Bellary contingent is doing a lot for the preservation and running of the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary, and various other animals and birds in the area. Here is the plus and minus of their efforts over a decade, described in Santosh's words:

"10 years back, I, Samad and Anand started our search for the 3 critically endangered species, The Great Indian Bustards, Long Billed Vultures and the Jerdon's Coursers. Of the three, we were successful in rediscovering, documenting and moni
toring two of them, The Great Indian Bustard and The Long Billed Vultures and Search for Jerdon's Courser is still on. Bellary district's landscape is similar to Lanka malleswara wildlife sanctuary near Cuddapah in Andhra Pradesh. We started this project as Karthik always felt that there was possibility of finding these birds here in Bellary. Ever since we have not given up and are hopeful that one day we would find them. Mr Bharat Bhushan of BNHS rediscovered the Jerdonâ€™s Courser in Cuddapah district of Andhra Pradesh in 1986, almost 100 years after it was presumed to be extinct. Chavan from BNHS team who is currently working on the conservation of these birds, told me that there have been no sightings since August, 2010. This is bad news indeed."
