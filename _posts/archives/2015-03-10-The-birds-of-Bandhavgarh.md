Though it poured for 3 days of our stay in Bandhavgarh, we still saw a lot of interesting things on our safaris, and within the grounds of Nature Heritage Resort where we stayed. I'm just going to put up the birds that I was able to click (my friends Karthik, Manjula, Nitin and Sharmila, who were all carrying DSLRs, definitely got more, and better shots!). Let me start with the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo, a flaunty beauty which was a lifer for me.

Our list was 125 species of birds, from the 1st to the 4th of March...here's my list on eBird

Go on to the next friend's post if birds bore you, because here they come...
