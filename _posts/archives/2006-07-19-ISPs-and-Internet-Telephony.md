Don't normally blog about such topics, but steam is coming from under my collar on this issue. 

The news (thanks to <LJ user="jace"> for the quote) :

"<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In a letter to the DoT, the Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) said: "Internet telephony services can be offered in India either by an ISP specifically permitted to do so or by a unified access service licensee. However, several service providers such as Skype, Net2Phone, Yahoo, and MSN, are providing Internet telephony services to people in India. Most of these foreign service providers do offer termination in Indian fixed-line telephones as well."</P><P>The letter, sent on July 13, also said that these service providers do not possess the requisite licence as mandated by the Government of India, thus vitiating the level playing field for bona fide licensees, such as Indian ISPs.</P><P>â€¦</P><P>The Indian ISPs have pointed to a recent ban imposed on Skype by the South Korean Government for offering voice service without a licence.</P><P>The ISPs also said that the service could prove to be a threat to national security with no monitoring being done.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The Indian ISPs have pointed to a recent ban imposed on Skype by the South Korean Government for offering voice service without a licence.
The ISPs also said that the service could prove to be a threat to national security with no monitoring being done."

My opinion:


Typical of the govt-run Telephones Dept, which, in effect, is saying: . When we had a monopoly, we didl NOT provide customer services, and  charged the highest rates in the world for pathetic services. We made sure telephones were a luxury, and made people wait years for a telephone connection. When the telecommunications  opened  up,in spite of our efforts to keep it mired down,  we made a fanfare of opening up too and even now, we provide too little, toolate.&nbsp;Our services lag behind international standards, so much so that people try to avoid using them and give up landlines in their thousands. But we will go on trying to control things as much as we can&nbsp; and keep dragging the country back into the dark days of the monopoly raj.&nbsp; We will pretend that freedom will bring danger. We will try our level best to see that the customer NEVER gets what he deserves. We are the government, but we will oppress, in every way possible, those whom we govern. We will sit tight in our archaic cocoon and prevent progress under any pretext. We are&nbsp; supposed to be the government, but we are actually the&nbsp; controlling mafia.

This is exactly the same as keeping a woman unlettered and in a burqa; exposed, she might be "exposed to danger"; literate, she might not be willing to live in bondage. So...keep her&nbsp;chained, mentally and physically&nbsp;as long as you can...and say you revere womanhood so much , that women are saints, and therefore must be controlled for their own good.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This is just after the blocking of Blogspot in the most ham-handed way imaginable, without a care for how incompetent and ineffective that blockage may be...sites which helped Mumbaikars after the bomb blasts have been blocked...and they can only be reached through a Pakistan blogsite "tunnel". 

Chingaari, koi bhadkey, tho saavan aag bujhaayey....
Saavan jo agan lagaayey..usey kaun bujhaayey?

If a spark lights up, the monsoon wind blows it out--
If the monsoon wind itself lights a fire, who can put it out?
