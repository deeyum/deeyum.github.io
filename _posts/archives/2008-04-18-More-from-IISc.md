Since so many people liked that photo of the light on the gardens at IISc, here are a few more images....


Here's the light pouring on to the grass in front of the main building:

And here's one avenue, with a magnificient stand of trees:

And some plants (we call them Crotons) which are glowing blood-red in the backlight:

Next lot will be various flora that I saw there and then I will come to the Circle Goddess, yes, she IS really called that!
