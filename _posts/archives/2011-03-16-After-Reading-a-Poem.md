Words...
Have the power to move me.
They are birds
That beat their wings
In my heart....
The song each bird sings
Can be a balm...or a dart
That may make me think...and improve me.

How can strokes on a paper sheet
Or on a lit-up screen
Sound so sad...or so sweet?
What part of my brain
Do they touch...
That they can cause so much joy, or pain?
Do they touch my mind, or my heart..
When they move me so much?
Or...do they touch somewhere in between?
Are poems a science? Or an art?
