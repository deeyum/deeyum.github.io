David Frye (seen here, posing with all the wildlife on sale at the Zoo)  is a birder from Detroit, and the previous week we had taken him to Hoskote Lake. We had a good time, too!

<lj-cut text="Our time at the Quarry area, inside the Zoo, and at Flycatcher Avenue and Kingfisher Pond">

In the zoo, we hunted for this

GREAT PIED HORNBILL

all over the cage, and finally found him right next to us, huddling in the corner of the cage (not distressed at all!) and looking at us with a beady eye.

We saw a 

JUNGLE MYNA

trying, literally, to feather its nest:

This

TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER
 
deighted us:

The 

GULMOHAR or the MAYFLOWER

had started blooming:

The flowers of the

RAIN TREE

looked lovely, too.

The Kingfisher Pond (I was very happy to hear the guard in charge of boating call it by this name, and say, "A naturalist has named it!") looked green and peaceful:

Here's David, documenting something:

I couldn't id this tree:

the

QUEEN'S FLOWER

is another tree in full bloom everywhere now:

A

GARDEN LIZARD

displayed its scales:

Chandu and David walk down Flycatcher Avenue:

See the beauty of Flycatcher Avenue:

This is the only SMS I could get of the

GREY-BELLIED CUCKOO:

This 

PALE-BILLED FLOWERPECKER


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13886036662" title="DSC02036 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/13886036662_2848122408.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="DSC02036"></a>

looked quite greedy as it took a whole Singapore Cherry in its mouth (but it only sucked at the juice and threw the fruit down.)

this

PADDYFIELD PIPIT

foraged along the path to the Quarry Pond area:

perky little bird:

the

RED-WATTLED LAPWING

made its characteristic "Didyoudoit?" call:

It was lovely to see the Champaka Dhama temple on top of the sheet rock, from the orchard area:

a

PENINSULAR ROCK AGAMA (male)

showed its breeding colours:

This is a very non-green "green" photograph, of broken glass litter left behind by visitors:

Some of the animals on sale were very realistic!

We saw these two, with a net and a cage, and we hope they wer
e not going to catch butterflies, because that is illegal:

Everywhere, the

DARK BLUE TIGERs

were flitting around, on their annual migration:

David appeared to enjoy his morning, and we gave him a really democratic experience..we took him from my home to the zoo area by one rickety bus and brought him back in an even more rickety one!

Let me close with this close-up of the Queen's Flower:
