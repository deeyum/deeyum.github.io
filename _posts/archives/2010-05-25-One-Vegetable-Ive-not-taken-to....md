I've never eaten

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artichoke"> Artichokes </a>

before, so when D bought some, I wanted to try them out. He cooked them in the pressure cooker and we had them with some sour cream sauce.

I must say, the vegetable looks aesthetically so pleasing...it's like a green lotus! But as I was taught how to eat it...pull off the leaves one by one, eat the lower, fleshy parts, setting them aside, and then finally coming to the heart set in a thicket of spines...I was far less enchanted.

I feel eating an artichoke is a lot of work to get very little of actual stuff to eat, and those spines could get into your gum, too....

Reminds me of the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard-apple"> Custard Apple </a> or Seetaphal, which, to me, also represents a lot of work to get at a little bit of snot-like substance that I don't like the taste of, anyway!

If someone reading this does like artichokes or custard apples...tell me how you eat them!
