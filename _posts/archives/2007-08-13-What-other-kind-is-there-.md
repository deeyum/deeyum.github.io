From an invitation to a wildlife-related event on an egroup that I belong to:

During each event, we want every participant to get a liberal dose of pure and fresh oxygen. 

Where does one go for impure and stale oxygen?

Er...and it's important to note that this event is in Mumbai...! Perhaps it will be administered to us in little bottles...
