Today I volunteered for the very first Butterfly Festival in Karnataka.

But amongst other things... This purple variety of the Passion Flower somehow seems to represent, to me, the intensity of passion in life...the force that often keeps us going. I had heard the interpretation of the parts of the pistil representing the Pandavas, and the many petals, the Kauravas. Today I also heard the mythology of the flower representing the Apostles of Christ. How many meanings we invest in these beauties!
