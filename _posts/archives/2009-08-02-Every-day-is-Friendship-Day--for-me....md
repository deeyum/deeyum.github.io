Apparently it was Friendship Day a day or two ago (actually, all these days can be called Greeting Card Day or Help Archies or Hallmark Become Rich Day)...to me, every day is a day in which I revel in the friendships that sustain me.

So...here's a loving wish to all my LJ friends; whether I have met you in person, or not, you are all very dear to me.

Friends are the greatest treasure that I can have. Thank you!

I took this today in Forest Park...those are the battlements of the main building of Washington University, where A took her double Masters' degrees.
