I am an Unashamed Worshipper at my grandchildren's feet. Here's KTB's rendition of a sunflower:

And her "mehendi" drawing:

She's still drawing while her brother enjoys a home-made fruit-smoothie popsicle:

She thinks in the box:

And drinks in the box:

Meanwhile, the Booda is part of the Three Bears:

My winter hat was taken to dress them up and I just retrieved it from the trio.

(It was hidden under the green pillow!)
