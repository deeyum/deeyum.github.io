We had a rasta-roko to protest against the way the traffic has been, for months now, diverted through the calm, quiet, and narrow streets of J P Nagar while the powers that be sleep over the flyover work.....much promises, but I think, nothing will be done even now. 

The BTS buses just THUNDER past, and take turnings, especially the one in front of our apartment building, in third gear; they hate slowing down. Walking is a dangerous occupation in our part of Bangalore now. As for cycling...I am thinking of giving it up before I get badly injured.

I HATE politicians. May their guts rot.
