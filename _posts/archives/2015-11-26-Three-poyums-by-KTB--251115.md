Here are three poyums (well, I'm sure that's the way she'd spell it!) by KTB on a single sheet of paper,with her trademark spelling. The erth, the "gordon" (garden), and bees...

this is probably the first time that she's consciously made a rhyme!

I love her thought that if we were smaller than a bee, we could fly on its back!
