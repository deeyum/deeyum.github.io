I receive several internet forwards every day, and many of them are forwards that I have received before...but occasionally I see something that rivets me; here's one such video that I received.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wiltshire"> here </a>

 is the wiki entry about Stephen Wiltshire.

And 

<a href="http://video.stumbleupon.com/#p=0k4lsi1dql"> here </a>

is the video of him taking a helicopter trip over Rome, and then sketching it in such incredible detail!

What an amazing thing the human mind is!
