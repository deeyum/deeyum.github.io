KTB was sitting (or rather, standing) on the back seat of the car, and her parents were out buying stuff, so I decided to photograph her from outside.

I simply love this image though no self-respecting photographer would be caught dead owning up to taking a photograph like this!

You can see me with the camera, and the buildings behind me...and KTB is quite literally "in my face", as she smiles joyously at me. 

What wonderful, whole-hearted smiles children have! It's only later that we learn the polite smile, the fake laugh....
