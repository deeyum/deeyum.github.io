I went for a walk, and the setting sun made me think of <LJ user="asakiyume">...I clicked as I usually do, to send the pic to her, as I usually do....

I didn't realize that she was experiencing a different kind of sunset...my thoughts are with her now.

I'm hoping to meet a dear friend from Philly in St.Louis on Sunday....
