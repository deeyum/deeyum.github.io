....

<lj user="sanathreddy">, his friend Narayan and I went to Madivala Lake for a brief while to try our luck with birding...we saw some PELICANS, some GREY HERONS,&nbsp; PURPLE HERONS, CORMORANTS, and the amazing part of the brief time was Sanath's sharp-eyed sighting of a CHEQUERED KEELBACK looking for food along the edge of the lake.

And while coming back, we just HAD to stop to take photographs of the lovely rainbow....

I was surprised to notice what looked like a tiny Indian flag on the edge of the building's roof!
