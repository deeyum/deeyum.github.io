Just established contact on Skype with my daughter's mother in law on Skype and had a nice chat....how lovely it is that they are "just like us" and people whom we got along with famously from the first day 5 years ago that we met!

Our relationship, as "Sambandhi"s, is shorn of the usual expectations and I-am-superior-you-are-inferior status things that vitiate such a relationship in Indian culture sometimes. They care about my daughter and I feel very much at home with them. 

Long may it last!
