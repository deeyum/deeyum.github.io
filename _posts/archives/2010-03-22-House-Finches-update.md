This morning there was another outbreak of hostilities...I watched, riveted, as the male birds spiralled up and down in a welter of feathers, beaks and claws..but now, things seem to have been amicably resolved.

House Finch Pair no. 1 perches in the larger, left-hand-side Japanese maple, and the female brings nesting material to the young conifer on the LHS. 

House Finch Pair no. 2...ditto ditto ditto on the right-hand-side (smaller) Japanese maple, and the right-hand-side conifer.

Wow, if only we could resolve our conflicts so well!
