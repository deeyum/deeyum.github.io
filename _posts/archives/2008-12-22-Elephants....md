What beautiful creatures elephants are; we saw these two mothers with their calves, so delightful to see the young ones actually gambolling and playing with each other...

Here's one of them enjoying a dust-bath:

We didn't enjoy the ones WE had to take every day, travelling over the terrain...we looked quite grey overall, by the time we got back home each day, and a hot bath was very much required!
