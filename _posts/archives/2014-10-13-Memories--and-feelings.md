How to take the sting
Out of sad memories?

How to take the sting
Out of sad memories?
How to prevent the thoughts
From running down one's cheeks
In pearls of relived emotion?
Perhaps, one should store memories
Consciously; peel away the layers
Of emotion that make them memorable.
Leave the facts--what happened...
Like flowers laid away in books,
Which have no fragrance, no roundness,
But still bring back the remembered time,
One's memories can then take one back
To relive the times, without the wracking feelings
That wrenched at one's heart then, 
With deep pain and gut-wrenching agony.
Can one sanitize memories?
Or will they, as a friend says,
Always be associated with the emotions,
And shake one deeply each time
Those days pass once again before the mind's eye?
Is a sad memory always a living thing
That brings back those feelings 
That have been lying, forgotten, but present?
Or...can one mummify memories
And make of them life-like things
That yet have no pain...
Nor the power to bring agony to life afresh?
