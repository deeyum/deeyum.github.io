It was to be a 4-hour bus ride to get to Linkoping (by the way, the latter is pronounced lin-show-ping and the "shoping" is similar to the modern English "shopping"...there were markets which then grew into  these towns/cities .) Linkoping, the wiki entry tells me, was founded in 1287!

I started with a prismatic tram-shelter seat as we waited to get to the Central Station:

As we took the tram through Goteborg, to the central bus/train station, I saw some buildings.

I looked at what I felt must be an ancient water tower, and Google tells me that it is, indeed:

<lj-cut text="the journey.....">

An ancient church, probably..the solidity of those buildings!

We approached the Central Station:

It was a picture-postcard!

Nearby was an hotel:

As my bus left Goteborg, I didn't know what this more modern tower was:

Signs helped me know where we were headed:

A town that we passed:

Lovely to see the modern bus shelter and the ancient copper-covered cupola!

I realized that the Bus Gods must be appeased:

This was in Jonkoping:

Contrary to everything I'd heard, cars began to pile up (I counted more than forty in line!) at this traffic signal:

We were travelling along the large Lake Vattern.

Another beautiful spire:

Our drivers were Mike, and Pia, reflected here:

I saw windmills but didn't tilt at them:

Beautiful meadows sped past:

We arrived in Linkoping:

Ikea! I've always wanted to visit this place IN Sweden (I've visited in several other countries and cities).

I was hoping to see the Gota Canal, but I only saw the sign.

Fleecy clouds, pretty houses and green trees welcomed me:

A very witty sculpture of a hoop, with a dog looking askance at it, was at one roundabout (if you look carefully, you can see the small dog.)

The hoop itself was a marvel of balance!

I passed "Biltema", which my cyclist friend <lj user="prashanthchengi"> tells me is a cycle store:

Prashanth just finished the cycling marathon of Sweden...the Vatternrundan, a 300-km ride around Lake Vattern!

A quick view of the Linkoping Cathedral:

I hope to find out what this cigarette-lighter building is:

Was this a planetarium or telescope? I couldn't tell.

I didn't like these smokestacks quite so much!

But at Linkoping Station and Bus Stand, my journey came to an end!
