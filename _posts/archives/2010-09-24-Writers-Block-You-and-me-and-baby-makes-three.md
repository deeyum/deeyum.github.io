No...strange that you need a licence to drive a car, but to bring a  baby into the world and change it into a human being, the most complex task that a human being can imagine...any moron (or two) is allowed to do it!

But then...when I had my child, I was definitely not fit to have one...but I grew with her, and hopefully, I am a better parent...and hopefully, a good grand-parent...now.

So, sadly, it's only post-facto that someone's competence as a parent can be tested....
