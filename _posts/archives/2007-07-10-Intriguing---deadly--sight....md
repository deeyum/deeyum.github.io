Apparently, "deadly" has entered Kannada slang and means something, or someone, that is immediately impressive...a "deadly" outfit that one has on, or a "deadly" car that one has bought...well, I have, *indeed*, taken a "deadly" picture!

As you can imagine, I am thoroughly enjoying the S3IS...I call it my personal Mary's lamb.
