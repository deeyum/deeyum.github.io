Do not be angry
If you are met
With silence from another.
You may not know what screams
Echo in the silence of that person's soul.
Screams, not uttered,unheard
But no less a torment
To that other one,
Who cannot, through those screams
Hear your words, or sounds.
I wish we could speak and hear
From soul to soul, heart to heart,
Instead of from mouth to ear, and ear to mouth.
