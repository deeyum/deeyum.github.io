We are going...to visit <a href="http://www.serengeti.org/"> this wonderful place on earth, </a>  and will be visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro"> this place </a>, too...a two-week visit of a lifetime...wish us, and our photography, luck!

We've taken our yellow fever shots, which are still sitting in a solid lump on our forearms (did the doc inject 5 ml of slow-set concrete?), got our visas, and are scraping our lenses together...we leave on Sunday.

I am going to miss a lot of things, particularly my friends' LJ posts if I don't have internet access (though time is likely to be more of a problem)...if I am off LJ for a day I come back to find a whole bunch of interesting stuff and have to spend a long time going back until I am sure I haven't missed something...!
