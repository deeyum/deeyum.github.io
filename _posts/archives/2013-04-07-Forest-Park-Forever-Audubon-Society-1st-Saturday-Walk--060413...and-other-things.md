I didn't get the email informing me that the meeting point for today's walk had been changed to 

<a href="http://www.forestparkforever.org/experience/thingstodo/nature-walks/"> the Kennedy Forest area </a> 

from the usual

<a href="http://www.forestparkforever.org/experience/destinations-2/visitor-and-education-center/"> Visitor Center </a>

Having waited for a long time, I went out for a bit on my own. The Park was getting very crowded, with a Boy Scout event; and having spotted a 

TREE SWALLOW

and an early-sunbathing

RED-EARED SLIDER

I gave up and was walking back home. I was photographing various flowers blooming on the trees:

I clicked the 

CLOVER,

too:

I also clicked this beautiful Star of David in a derelict building (that I pass every day on my walk!)

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03583.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03583.jpg" border="0" alt="de baliviere window 060413 fp photo DSC03583.jpg" /></a>


....when Ruth Hartsell called, and said she would walk back and meet me at the History Museum and take me to the Kennedy Forest area....which she did, very kindly!

We went past this tree of stainless steel:


<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03596.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03596.jpg" border="0" alt="art tree 060413 fp photo DSC03596.jpg" /></a>


This piece of art (the cost of which, I cannot help thinking,would have planted several real trees!) is called The Placebo:

Can you imagine, it comes with its own steel mushrooms:

Several kites were flying in the sky, and there was another ringbow around the sun:

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03594.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03594.jpg" border="0" alt="kites ringbow 060413 fp photo DSC03594.jpg" /></a>


Thanks to Ruth,  I didn't miss out on the outing, as I would have, otherwise. The group had, apparently, split up into two, and ofkose Murphy's Law mandated that the other group saw the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_Owl"> BARRED OWLS </a>

that I've been wanting to see for the longest time! However, we did catch up with the group:

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03600.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03600.jpg" border="0" alt="bding gp 060413 fp photo DSC03600.jpg" /></a>

and   saw a lot of interesting birds, including the

DOWNY WOODPECKER


<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03612.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03612.jpg" border="0" alt="downy wdpkr 060413 fp photo DSC03612.jpg" /></a>

and the TUFTED TITMOUSE:

The pathways in the Kennedy Forest area have some beautiful wooden bridges:

As we finished our walk, Ruth identified this

VIOLET

for me.

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03635.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03635.jpg" border="0" alt="violet 060413 fp photo DSC03635.jpg" /></a>

This flower is supposed to be the epitome of shyness and modesty :)

I came home, and remembered to click these flowers at home:

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/user/mnypx/media/DSC03574.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/DSC03574.jpg" border="0" alt="lvndr? 060413 fp photo DSC03574.jpg" /></a>

'I don't know if this is lavender,but it has a very heady scent.

I'd bought some early CHRYSANTHEMUMS from the store last week, when it was particularly gloomy:

Ruth was then kind enough to drop me home as well, because I'd been walking continuously for more than four hours! I'm glad I have Ruth in my life, it would  be much more boring if I was Ruthless!
