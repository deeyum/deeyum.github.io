As I tried using the Tamron lens on my walks in LA, I snapped many pictures of garden flowers; I realize that it seems rather "infra-dig" (beneath one's dignity, in a very Indian idiom!) to post pictures of garden flowers...but I have no dignity, being still a photographer who is an L board (another Indian idiom for someone who is learning )...so I am going to post some pictures of flowers...

Here's the bird of Paradise, which I thought I had posted on earlier post but apparently did not:

These were berries, not flowers (and in St Louis, the mockingbirds fed on these berries)

this one isn't a flower, it's a lemon, but it was in someone's garden so here goes:

these are not flowers or fruits or berries...but candies which are actually Christmas lights, but they were in a garden, too, so they go in, too...

and here are flowers whose names I *do*know, which by any other name would smell as sweet:

Well, that's my floral tour, and I will use it to cheer myself up every now and then!
