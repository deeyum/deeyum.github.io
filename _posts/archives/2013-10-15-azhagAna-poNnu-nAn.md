I suddenly remembered a song I'd heard in my infancy...after months of not wanting to learn new songs, Kavya is suddenly keen again, now! 

<lj-embed id="1050"/>


The words mean,

"I am a beautiful girl;
I have the eyes for that;
The only thing I possess
Is my self-respect..."

The original song  is here (from a 1956 film, imagine!)

and the lyrics are:

<lj-cut text="You want to see the lyrics and their meaning?">

Azhagaana ponnu naan 
Adhukkeththa kannuthaan 
Engitta iruppadhellaam thanmaanam ondruthaan 

I am a beautiful girl
I have the eyes for that
The only thing I have is my self-respect

Eedillaa kaattu Roja 
Idhai neenga paarunga 
Evarenum parikkavandhaa inimethaan maarunga 
Mulley thaan kuththunga 

A peerless forest rose
Do look at this
If anyone comes to pluck it, its nature will change;
It's the thorn that will prick.

HO.... ankonnu ilikkudhu aandhai poal muzhikkidhu 
Aattathai rasikkavillai aalaithaan rasikkidhu (Azhagaana)

There is one grins, that stares like an owl
Not enjoying the dance, just enjoying the dancer

HO.. hO.... hO... 
Ingonnu ennaippaaththu kan jaadai pannudhu (2)
Aemaali ponnuyinnu aedhedho ennu edhedho ennuthu

Here, one is making sheep's eyes at me
Thinking various things, assuming I'm a gullible girl

HO.... hO... hO... 
Penjaadiyai thavikkavittu peyaattamaakkudhu 
Piththaagi ennai suththi kaiththaalm poadudhu (Azhagaana)

Leaves the wife to suffer, and acts like a demon
Crazily follows me, clapping (to my dance)

It's a very mid-Eastern, Arabic type of dance number...and talks about the uncaring ogling of men! So I taught her only the first four lines.
