In the middle of taking the required "people" pics, I thought of focusing on the foot of the bride.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9190033@N03/649003680/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1138/649003680_2c93d7fb67.jpg" width="500" height="327" alt="IMG_0635 9 yards and Metti" /></a>

She is wearing a beautiful "mayil kazhutthu" (neck-of-the-peacock)Kanchipuram silk 9-yards saree, that is traditonally worn for the actual wedding ceremony; her foot is decorated with intricate maruthANi (mehendi) patterns; she wears a silver anklet, and just a few minutes ago, the "metti" (toe-ring) was put on her second toe, a mark of her being married.

The  pAy (rush mat) on which she is standing is one that will be gifted to the newlweds, it usually bears, woven in, the name of the couple and the wedding date (you can see part of the "2007")...the flowers scattered around her feet were showered upon the couple in benison.
