kaun hO thum,kaun hO, kaun hO?

kavi kI madhur kalpanA hO thum yA gAyak kee madhurim thAn
yA sarithA jal kI tharang hO ...aruN kamal kI madhu muskAn (kaun hO)

ritu basant kI pratham kali hO...sAwan kI pehlI barsAt
yA chir virhI do hrudyOn kI madhur milan kI pehlI rAth (kaun hO)

praNay geet kI praTHam pankthi hO yA manu kI pehlI santhAn
nav youvan kI praTHam drishti hO...nainOn kI pehlI pehchAn (kaun hO)


Who are you, who?

Are you the tender fancy of a poet, or the sweet notes of a singer?
Or the waves of a little stream...or the sweet smile of a lotus?

Are you the first bud of Spring...or the first rain of the monsoon?
or are you the first night of the renunion of long-sundered hearts?

Are you the first line of a sweet song, or the first child of Manu?
Are you the first sight of Youth, or the first meeting of the eyes?

Who are you?


Hadn't remembered this song in quite a while...and haven't posted about songs in quite a while...<lj user="inspirethoughts">....where are you?
