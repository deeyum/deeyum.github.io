When a man in our community (Tambrams, or Tamizh Brahmins) attains the age of 60, he and his wife undergo a wedding ceremony again, this time with greater emphasis on the Vedic rituals, and the spirituality.

Our friends Devika and Anand had the "whole 9 yards" ceremony, with pomp and colour, at

Where 60th, 70th, and 80th "abdha poorthi" rites (attainment in years) are often performed, often dozens at a time.
