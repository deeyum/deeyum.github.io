Madhu just took me to the very beautiful 

<a href="http://www.sspeterpaulcathedral.catholicweb.com/"> Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul </a>.

The gilded cross atop the dome beckons to the faithful (and the tourists):

My irreverent mind, of course, immediately added "Mary" to Peter and Paul and flew off to "Puff the Magic Dragon"...see this audience-inclusive rendition by the group:

Mary of the group recently 

<a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20305126,00.html"> passed away </a>.


Well, now that I went down that side-road and came back,...here's the outside of the cathedral:

Madhu opening the lovely old door:

Inside, the dim vastness of the church instantly silenced our voices and thoughts; the peace was like a blanket that spread itself over us. This, to me, is what religion should be about...the spiritual uplifting that makes one's soul, mind, and heart go beyond themselves to something greater. I have felt this in various places...the most unexpected one was the Necropolis near Teheran.

Here's the scene that greets one's eyes on entering the doors:

There were several beautifully executed paintings:

The stained glass in the cathedral was wonderful...how I wish had a digital camera in the six consecutive days that I visited the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral"> Cathedral at Cologne </a>, 

many years ago!

But...as the big striped cat said to the tourist who exclaimed that he'd seen a diger..."I digress!"

Here are a couple of panels, one from above the nave:

And one above the entrance:

Looking back from the nave, I saw the large and impressive church organ:

On the side of the church were these sumptuously appointed confessionals:

I'm afraid I'm not a very devout person, because I thought of the several novels in which the murderer uses the confessional to aid his plans!
