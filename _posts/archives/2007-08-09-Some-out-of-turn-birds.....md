Had a hectic day, and just don't have the time to make a long post of the next day at Ngorongoro Crater and the trip to the Serengeti...so I am going to post some photos of birds in no particular order...

The LILAC-BREASTED ROLLER


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061025433/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1205/1061025433_10b5e110d3_o.jpg" width="430" height="480" alt="a picture for you" /></a>


That same roller, taking off (I am thinking of <LJ user="sainath"> and <LJ user="dearchcichi"> and <LJ user="shivakumar_l">)

The GLOSSY STARLING (as beautiful as the Superb Starling)

Some WHITE-BROWED ROBIN-CHATS on a bush

A STREAKY-THROATED BARBET eating breakfast




<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061403669/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1263/1061403669_ac041fd9ec_o.jpg" width="480" height="456" alt="D'Arnaud's Barbet" /></a>


and a RED-BILLED HORNBILL on an acacia bush (imagine sitting comfortably on a plant with thorns like that...must have been an Indian fakir in its last birth! And I think it needs lessons in applying lipstick, too...)


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10995900@N07/1061871842/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1054/1061871842_3992aac1c0_o.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="Red-billed Hornbill" /></a>





OK, OK, tomorrow we will have the cheetahs eating the gazelle, and the lions walking on the road....I prooooomise!
