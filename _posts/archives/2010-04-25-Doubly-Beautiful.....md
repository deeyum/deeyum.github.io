We had a hailstorm, and watching the storm moving in was awe-inspiring. Within a few minutes of the hailstorm beginning, the tornado siren went off, and we had to go to the basement to wait until the all-clear blew again. 

We then came out, and the storm had rapidly passed...soon the sun came out, and A was wishing that there was a rainbow. I told her that there had to be some rain for a rainbow...and lo and behold, a light shower happened, and she got her wish...

And the double rainbow got stronger:

What can be more beautiful than a rainbow, as a sign from above, that the storm has passed, and the sunshine is back? The answer...two rainbows!
