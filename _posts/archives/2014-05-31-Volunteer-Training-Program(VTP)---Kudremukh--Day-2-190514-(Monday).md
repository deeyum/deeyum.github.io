Here's my account of day 2:

Monday, 190514, Day 2

Dr Ramesh, the RFO of the Kudremukh range, made a presentation which started with the general concepts of Protected Areas, National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Reserves, such as Community., Tiger, Biosphere and Elephant, and then talked specifically of the Kudremukh, which he lauded as one of the best forest regions in Karnataka, as well as being grassland habitat.

VMR gave a presentation to illustrate the value of photography in wildlife conservation:

Post-lunch, S. Karthikeyan, Chief Naturalist, JLR, introduced the participants to “Lesser” life forms, and showed how interesting they could be. Heavy rain repeatedly interrupted his presentation but it was still an eye-opener to the participants.

The pouring rain brought down the temperature as well as the sheets of rain, and it was beautiful to see this 

BICOLORED FROG:

This ladybird isn't alive; she's been predated by a spider, but what remains of her is covered by raindrops:

<lj-cut text="a few more photos....">

I wish I had names for some of the beautiful wildflowers we saw:

This 

JUNGLE PRINIA

hid amongst the rain-dripping leaves:

A

COMMON PIERROT

delighted us:

A lot of 

GARCINIA GUMMIGATA

trees are being planted around the camp:

I am unable to get the id of this beautifully flowering tree:

The rain also brought out many 

LEECHES;

here's one on Basava's finger:

We saw the camera traps being taken to be set up (alas, they didn't get anything much..that's the way it happens!)

This

HAWK MOTH 

caterpillar had come out, too:

I wish I had names for all the wildflowers we saw. Some, like this

OSBECKIA,

were provided by friends:

Others remained unknown:

I can't get an id for these fruits and trees, either:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14280724284" title="DSC04479 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/14280724284_902e174aa5_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04479"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14301377193" title="DSC04469 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3703/14301377193_714c480f42_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04469"></a>


The ferns looked beautiful, but we learnt later that 

PTERIDIUM

(commonly called Bracken)

is an invasive species and is probably harmful for the ecosystem there:

Karthik helped a participant get a macro shot of a Skipper:

The landscape, as we went for our walks, continued to be stunning:

From the distant slopes, a

SAMBHAR 

doe looked alertly at us:

Underfoot, a 

FUNNEL WEB SPIDER

guarded her rain-bespangled web:

A 

SLUG

meandered along:

Since the area is politically unsettled, an Anti-Naxal Unit van was often parked in the camp:

Off we went for a good rest, to be fresh on Day 3....
