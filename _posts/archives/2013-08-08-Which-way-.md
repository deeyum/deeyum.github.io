I could go up that fence in two ways. Be stiff, uncompromising, straight up. But that might mean, I'd be wooden, and dead.

I could compromise, bend to the needs of the terrain, and grow in lateral ways. I'd be green and thriving, but I might not be straight.

Are there any simple answers to how I must meet a situation? What's good, what's bad? Depends upon me....
