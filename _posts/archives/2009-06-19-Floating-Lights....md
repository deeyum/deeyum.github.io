Remember <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/545509.html"> my post about fireflies </a>? Well, here's the video version...

We are getting the fireflies every day right in front of our own home; a couple of days ago, we were all sitting on our front porch, and the "lightful" and delightful feast started....

I know that's very grainy, but I was in a great hurry to catch the little firefly and didn't even think of changing my settings!

Do fireflies keep getting bright ideas? :)

That put me in mind of the 1973 Hindi movie, Jugnu (Firefly)...and I tried getting a video of a favourite song of mine, but couldn't find any...here's an audio-only version, not very clear, but good enough:

And here are the lyrics:

That's really BADLY written, will get down to writing the words out properly, but Biddly is calling right now, so "badly" will have to wait!...
