Deepak Edwin, one of my FB friends, asked, "Do you ever rest?" The answer is....

Everest is the name of a mountain
For me, an unscaled peak.
I toil along in the foothills
With the ills and with the thrills.
Only I'm dead, I'll be blest
With eternal Ever-rest!
So as long as I draw breath
I'll be up and doing, and only death
Can still my heart in my chest
And give me my Ever-rest.

And Deepak, here IS Everest...
