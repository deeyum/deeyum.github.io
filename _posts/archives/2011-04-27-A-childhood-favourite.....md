I don't even remember how, or when, I learnt this song. I think I learnt it by osmosis!
 I didn't know that it was a movie song, and I didn't know the movie. I just suddenly decided to google for it....and there it was...in Asha Bhonsle's lovely voice.

is my rendition of it, obviously, a little different, with all those years of never hearing the original. And I have taken it at a much lower pitch.
