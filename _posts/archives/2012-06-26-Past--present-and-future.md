The sunlight falls 
On the young face.
It's the face of the future.
That's lighted up by the sun's rays
Lit up by a light from the past...
Eight minutes ago, to be precise.
Eight minutes ago, she was younger;
Now, is she old, or wise?
Perhaps, on a starry night,
She will be illuminated
By the stellar light
From aeons ago...which waited
Till the present. to shine on her form.
The past, the present, and her own future
Mesh together in this light, soft and warm.
