CMB...and what a lot of them there are!

I think I have been extremely lucky in life. 

I have good health in general. I can eat what I want, when I want.

I have (I think, of course!) the best spouse in the world.

Thanks to a financially savvy spouse, I enjoy having enough money, with no wants...and more wonderful is the fact that I do not HAVE to work for a living, and am free to pursue a lot of interests. 

I am lucky to be interested in a lot of things, and like learning.

I had parents who brought me up in a very simple way. I am not very materialistic, so I have happiness as much as pleasure.

I am lucky enough to live in a city that I really love.

 I am lucky enough to be reasonably good at the things I am interested in, and bad enough at them  to have a continuous learning process...and I enjoy that too.

My child is a caring, responsible adult that the world can lean on, and she is happy in her life and career.

I have the ability to laugh...at the world, at myself. Oh..a great gift. A sense of the ridiculous is a tremendous spirit-booster. There is no mental morass that one cannot break free of with a cackle.

I have the ability to reach out to people of all kinds, and mostly (<LJ user="amoghavarsha"> please note that word!) they reciprocate. And so it happens that I come to my next blessing..

...Friends. I am truly, truly blessed in my friends. They laugh with me, cry with me, laugh at me,like me, sometimes love me, support me, and surround me. One or two deep friendships would be miraculous in life...I have several.

If there is reincarnation and karma, I must have been a SAINT in my last birth, to merit this wonderful life that I lead! (Alas, my next birth is probably going to be as a lowly worm...but I hope to be a happy, contented worm!)

Here are the tender, beautiful new leaves of the Banyan tree (
Ficus Bengalensis) that I snapped during the Bird Race...that will tell you how relaxed we were, ambling around..not once did my teammates rush me!

A day out in the open, in pleasant weather, with good people around me...what more can one ask for?
