Yesterday, at the mall near my home, I watched the dance sequences  of a movie being shot...all through the day.

You can see some of  the artistes in costume in the  centre of the crowd:

Everything was being  recorded...

Here are some of the artistes, dancing on cue:

You can hear my maid Lakshmi and my neighbour Pallavi  exchanging observations!

For some reason, animal  balloons  formed a large part of the sequences:

Several were released  in the  evening...here's a tiger floating past!

The women artistes were accompanied by family members, who waited through the day:

Here's the van in which a lot  of the  props and  equipment was  stored...

The  sign on the side of the van says, "PoorNimA hOrangaNa chitreekaraNa ghatikE". (Poornima Outdoor Movie-making Unit).

What movie? Will this scene make it to the theatres, or end up on the cutting-room floor? Who knows!
