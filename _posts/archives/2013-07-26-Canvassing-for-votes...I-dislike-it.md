Dear Blogger, Photographer, or anyone else canvassing for my "valuable vote".

I dislike the practice of canvassing for votes. 

I have several friends in the running for several competitions, and I am voting for no one, because often I will be voting for one friend at the cost of another. How "valuable" could my vote be, if canvassing by you can secure it, not the intrinsic merit of your post or photo?

I don't like to be told what I should do, even in a humorous vein. Eg, "Write good things, or lie if you like..... Note the topics, and emphasise on those" Why on earth would I want to do all that? 

I blog myself. I don't badger anyone to see my blogs. I post photos. I do not pester others to see my photos, or vote for them. I do not enter competitions as I too might turn to this kind of canvassing. 

It's not your problem; it's mine. I do not like canvassing, that's all. Have you seen the sentence, "Canvassing in any form will disqualify the candidate?" I wish that rule would apply. When you need to cast around for votes, there's something fundamentally wrong...or at least, that's my opinion. 

I enjoy reading your posts, seeing your photographs. But I don't like coercion or persuasion of any kind, and I don't believe that we need to be competitive all the time. By all means let me know if you are in a competition...and then...please leave it to me to vote, or not, as I wish. Do not apply pressure of any kind.

This is not aimed at anyone in particular; it's a general statement about my dislike of canvassing.(And it's worse when I am bcc'd for canvassing!)
