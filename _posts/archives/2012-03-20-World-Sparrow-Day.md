Today is World Sparrow Day, and I too will be taking part in a panel discussion on the topic of these lovely, perky birds, that suddenly seemed to vanish from the Bangalore urban scene.

to see the schedule for today.

However, they do seem to be making a comeback lately, and that is probably what I will mention during the discussion this evening.

I'd posted some time ago about the "Building-a-House" Sparrow:

And, from the same area, posted this video of a sparrow and the rear-view mirror:

I do love sparrows, and was grieved, a few years ago, to see a notice in Forest Park, St.Louis, that said, "House sparrows are an immigrant species, and they can be killed and their nests destroyed" or something to that effect. Thankfully, the notice has been removed now. Of all countries, I cannot imagine America forgetting that the immigrants of today are the citizens of tomorrow!
