I am committed to the idea that the best parent is one who brings up a child to be an adult, who has a life that need have no reference to the parent, who has the strength of mind to take responsiblity and take hes own decisions....therefore, am keeping very quiet about a tough decision that my child is in the process of making....but still, I feel the pull of the umbilical cord halfway across the world....

Even spouses may not be for life, but children are...
