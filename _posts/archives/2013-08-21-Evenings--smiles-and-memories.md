Lyrics:

Woh shaam kuch ajeeb thi, 
yeh shaam bhi ajeeb hai, 
Woh kal bhi paas paas thi, 
woh aaj bhi kareeb hai, 
Woh shaam kuch ajeeb thi, 
yeh shaam bhi ajeeb hai, 
Woh kal bhi paas paas thi, 
woh aaj bhi kareeb hai, 
Woh shaam kuchh ajeeb thi, 

That evening, too, was special;
This evening, too is so:
That was near (to my heart)
And so is this.

Jhuki hui nigaahon mein, 
kahin mera khayaal tha, 
Dabi dabi hansi mein ek, 
haseen saa gulaal tha, 
Main sochta tha, 
mera naam gunguna rahi hai woh, 
mera naam gunguna rahi hai woh, 
Na jaane kyon laga, mujhe, 
ke muskura rahi hai woh, 
Woh shaam kuch ajeeb thi

My thoughts were somewhere
In those downcast eyes
In that muted smile,
There was the colour of laughter.
I thought...
She was humming my name.
I don't know why, but I felt
That she was smiling...

Mera khayaal hai abhi, 
jhuki hui nigaah mein, 
Khuli hui hansi bhi hai, 
dabi hui si chaah mein, 
Main janta hoon, mera naam, 
gunguna rahi hai woh, 
Yahi khayaal hai, mujhe, 
ke saath aa rahi hai woh, 
Woh shaam kuch ajeeb thi, 
yeh shaam bhi ajeeb hai, 
Woh kal bhi paas paas thi, 
woh aaj bhi kareeb hai, 
Woh shaam kuchh ajeeb thi...

My thoughts are still
With those downcast looks
There's open laughter
In the suppressed longing.
I know that she is
Humming my name
I feel that she is
Coming along with me.....

Such simple words... yet, such powerful poetry, and the music and voice lifts the song to further heights.
