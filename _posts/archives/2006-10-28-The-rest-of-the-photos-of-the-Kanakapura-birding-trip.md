Now that I have the id of the other birds which I was not sure of, here are some of the other&nbsp; photos from the trip:

This is a Yellow-Billed Babbler; I was confused about which type of babbler it was (KM often refers to me as the Bannerghatta Road Babbler.)

OK, OK, I know it isn't crisp and nice, but "documentation" shots can get away with it....!


I posted the photo of the male Indian robin yesterday, here's the female; she was sitting on the ground not very far from the male. We were hoping that we might get some feeding shots, but no luck, a motorcycle drove past and off they went!

We also saw several Green Bee-Eaters. It is <lj user="Amoghavarsha">'s opinion that bee-eaters are the most beautiful birds, and that girls should be complimented that they are "bee-eaters" instead of the widely prevalent compliment of "bulbuls" or "mynahs"! I do love their raffish "masked bandit" look, which they share with other birds like shrikes, their colours, graceful bodies, and&nbsp; lovely tails..

Hey, <lj user="birdonthewire">....that photo was for you!

And here's a picture of a tiny wildflower that <lj user="amoghavarsha"> took; I was taking the pictures of the same flower&nbsp; on his camera; it was a revelation to me that a fair shot of such a small-sized object could be taken with the Canon lens too, I thought a macro lens was needed. I have joined a wildflower egroup, but realize that it would be next to impossible for me to start identifying them. So this will remain a mystery wildflower (unless some kind reader id's it for me!)

We also saw some CATTLE EGRETS,&nbsp; a beautiful YELLOW WAGTAIL, a JUVENILE BRAHMINY KITE, several breath-taking flights of ROSE-RINGED PARAKEETS, some of which really flew right between us, swooping as they enjoyed the evening air, some COPPERSMITH BARBETS, and of course the RUFOUS TREEPIE, the picture of which I so carelessly deleted from my CF card...and there were the usual complement of COMMON MYNAHS, HOUSE CROWS, BLACK KITES keeping us company throughout.
