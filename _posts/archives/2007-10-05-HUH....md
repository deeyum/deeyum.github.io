I joined something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelfari">  Shelfari  </a> and had added a few books, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.K._Narayan">  R K Narayan's </a> <a href="http://www.wmich.edu/dialogues/texts/swamiandfriends.htm">  Swami and Friends </a>  , which is one of my all-time favourites. So today I tried to add <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/theguide.html"> The Guide </a> to my list and lo and behold (or rather, low and don't behold), it wasn't listed at all!

HUH...that's the last of Shelfari!
