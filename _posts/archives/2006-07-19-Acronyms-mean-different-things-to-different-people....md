<P>...


I was feeling thrilled when <lj user="kalyan"> told me that 12 of his photographs are going to be exhibited in the World Wildlife Fund exhibition in New Delhi. When my husband came home in the evening, I excitedly told him, "They are exhibiting 12 photos of Kalyan in the WWF exhibition in Delhi!" My brother in law who has just come in from Arizona (and who has a 6 year old son, which is probably very pertinent to this anecdote!) piped up: "Oh? WWF? This guy Kalyan is a professional wrestler?"

I had to tell him that the only wrestling Kalyan is&nbsp;involved in, &nbsp;is between his software work and his passion for B R Hills...still laughing at the thought of Kalyan slapping his thighs and throwing people out of the ring in an outlandish outfit!</P>
