I received a loving email (which made it past the spam filters!)



*****************

Dear Beloved,

I am Mrs. Stacy Russell.I am writing you this email from my sick bed, I know my message will come to you as a surprise But don't worry. When I heard from the doctor that my condition has become so critical, I had to reach out to a Christian sister, who assisted me in searching for your contact in order to help me utilize this wealth the way I am going to instruct herein, and even the sister that helped me in this regard doesn't know the purpose for which I intend to use it I have prayed about it and it has been revealed to me that you can make judicious use of the resources for its intended purpose.

My husband earned these funds, (TEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND) but he died in a plane crash and left everything behind for me and I will join him soon due to my ill health. Due to my infertility resulting from medical problems I became barren. God has a reason for everything. I would want you to contact my lawyer; he will inform you on what to do. Reply to this email and email my Lawyer:
SINA HOK CHAMBERS
PHNOM PENH
Barrister Sina HOK
Email: (llb.sina@sinahok.com)

Ensure to use a greater portion of the funds for its purpose in fulfillment of my last wish. Furthermore you will never have any problem with the law as far as my lawyer is in concern. The most major part you will use to bless Helpless and Needy Children all over the world

May God Keep you alive and bless you as you help.

Somehow I feel that the barrister (and the lady herself) is not "Hok" but "Hoks"!
