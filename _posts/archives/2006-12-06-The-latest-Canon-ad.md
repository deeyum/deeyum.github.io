The latest Canon ad has what I think is one of the most amazing pictures ever....a picture of a bubble in the act of bursting. 

I want to know how I can get a URL of the picture...I really do want to store this amazing photograph! And the ad doesn't say WHO shot that picture...I am hoping to get some more info I guess.

Can anyone help me? WHAT a photograph.... 

I remember being amazed by Lenart(spelling?) Neilssen's photographs many, many years ago, in Life magazine...of the human body, of a drop of fluid, of a speeding bullet...they captured, like this one, moments, or micromoments, that exist, but which the human eye cannot see.
