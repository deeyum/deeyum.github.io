It was a wonderful visit to Ramngara, with Abhinandan, a birder from Calicut, Amith, and Mani.

We started the morning with beauty.

The view from the betta (hillock) was lovely:

Two

EGYPTIAN VULTURES

soared over us.

The

YELLOW-THROATED BULBUL

took a long time in showing itself, but Abhinandan was delighted (and so were we) when it finally showed up!

The

JERDON'S BUSHLARK

sang the early morning raga:

It was heartening to see the critically endangered Long-billed Vulture in the only nesting site in south India...and that too, a female on her nest.

Oh well..Flickr is suddenly misbehaving and letting me upload only 3 pics at a time..so that's all you are going to get at present! :D
