Though I am usually up at  3.30am, I carry on with my walk to, and in, Forest Park...

Here's a lovely flower, from a very large tree that I cannot name:

They are strewn all over the place, and as I walk, I also enjoy the sweet scent of the honeysuckle.


I find this very interesting newspaper vendor on my way back; he's got his "head-umbrella" on in case it rains again...there have been heavy showers and a town 100 miles away (Joplin) got devastated by a tornado:

I come home and settle down to some recording on Muziboo, having put some of the roses I got, into a vase next to me:

But almost immediately, KTB is sent home from daycare with a low-grade fever, and she thoroughly takes over the rest of the day, until, at about 6pm, I turn her over to her Thatha, and collapse in utter exhaustion!
