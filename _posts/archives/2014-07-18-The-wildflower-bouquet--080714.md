<LJ user="kejn"> took me for a wonderful morning of nature and birding trails...â€‹Klingansvalsan (Vomb) Lake, and Silvakra. We had lovely sightings of birds, insects, mammals, took in some beautiful scenery....but I was also thinking of Fran, a very indoor person, whom we'd left behind. So I picked these wildflowers for her!

I asked N to hold it, too...

I came home and gave it to Fran, who said she'd not got a bouquet of flowers for goodness knows how long!

It looked so very beautiful, sitting on the table in the central courtyard at N's home:

Here's Fran, with N, as they work on some details of their trip to Berlin:

Friends...are worth their weight in wildflowers!
