Had the party...everyone, from the knowledgeable to the curious, came....we did have fun, but I do feel that this whole wine-and-cheese thing lends itself to a lot of pompous hot air. What is the snob value of knowing about wine and cheese? I propose to have another party with Jal Jeera and Bisi Bela Huli Anna and pontificate endlessly about it all through the evening!
