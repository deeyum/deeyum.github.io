I must say, though, that cycling has got progressively more dangerous in this city of mine. I recently developed a calf muscle problem that has put cycling on hold for at least a while....but even before that, I had given up cycling over distances longer than 10km, and definitely, cycling in the evening. I want cycling to improve my health, and a traffic accident could be a major health problem!

But I do like the idea of replacing driving a car with cycling wherever possible, and I liked this logo that was used at one of  the Cycling Workshop presentations:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6894.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6894.jpg" border="0" alt="cycling over driving logo cycling workshop 310109"></a>

Logos are such effective ways of putting across a message without ever saying a word!
