Call it the Housewife Syndrome (not having enough to do, so engaging in such thoughts):


I got the link to

<a href="http://www.bam.org/view.aspx?pid=1253"> this dance duo </a>

See the way they dance....you do feel the fusion between them. So...what I wonder is, when two dancers dance *together* like that...no matter what their genders...is it only a working relationship? Would they have to be lovers to give that sense of oneness? Or would mundane things like sweat and worrying about the choreography come in the way of a personal relationship? 

I wonder this when I see ice-skating, and ballet routines, too.

One movie which showed the attraction between two singers, and then showed their happy marriage crumbling under the stress of one singer's success, was

(this movie also a beautiful song about a baby-in-the-future.)

Having said that, I also know several purely professional relationships which have worked well, such as the one between

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivaji_Ganesan"> Sivaji </a>

and 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitri_%28actress%29"> Savitri </a>

who, after they were featured as brother and sister in 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasamalar"> "pAsa malar"</a>

were only accepted as such by the Tamizh film-going public thereafter!


Well...whatever the reality may be...such dances, duets, ballets, jugalbandis, recitals...are wonderful to watch, or listen to.

So...what do YOU think? For one's talents to fuse into a synergy, should one's heart also fuse with that of one's partner?
