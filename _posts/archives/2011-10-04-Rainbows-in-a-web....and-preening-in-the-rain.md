You have to watch this video carefully to get the effect.

This is a

FUNNEL WEB SPIDER (or WOLF SPIDER)

web, on the ground.

As I move the point of view, the sun's rays hit the web, and prismatic colours appear in a kind of sheen. Do watch...it's stunningly beautiful!

Only a birdbrain would think of sitting in the rain to preen oneself!  Here's an

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN

sitting on a pole, preening itself and drying itself busily...it seems unaware that it is still raining!

You can hear the rain!
