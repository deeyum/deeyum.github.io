...P2B.

(P stands for pAti....mother of a mother or father..a mother in this case...) 

Having been quite worried about the results of some tests for more than 6 weeks, I still cannot bring myself to use the actual words...how incredibly irrational and stupid! ;-)

For the first time in my life, I rue  the great physical distance between myself and my child...Well, not really RUE, but I do wish teleportation had already been invented...."beam me up, Scotty!" would be SO much easier than "WHAT? do I have to transit through that ORRIBLE Charles De Gaulle hairyport AGAIN?" to my travel agent...

My bebby...I keep wanting to be at your side, and I completely forget that I was alone, too, when I was expecting you, and I managed fine!
