Today I am feeling lazy to write, but I was thinking of my "Oho" friend.

Oho friend?

Well, I wrote about "Oho info"

Let me add this photo of some of us at Sultanpur, Delhi...I like the feel of the photograph!

Nature's path is unending...
Delightful suprises in store...
We follow the road, wending
Our way, forever more!
