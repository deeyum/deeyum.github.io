I'd finished my walk, and was coming home, when I suddenly looked up, and saw a Red-tailed Hawk being chased all over the sky by Grackles and Robins:

Though they were rather high above me, and moving fast, I tried to aim and shoot.

The Hawk got away from them, and then started circling, looking for other prey:

I left it, still master of the sky:

If you'd like to see the close encounter I had with the Red-tailed Hawk (probably the same one, it's resident in the neighbourhood!)...

to see how I do birding with a child in tow!
