The only birding photography  I did was a while ago, when I went to Bannerghatta Forest area and spotted these INDIAN SILVERBILLS...

 to Lalbagh one morning by myself, and I saw this LITTLE CORMORANT sunning itself,

But a few days ago I went to the Press Club of Bangalore, in Cubbon Park, with a friend of mine and I found these common but beautiful ROSE-RINGED PARAKEETS in the tree:

All very well for famous birders to say "Birds are all around us"...the only ones we normally get to see are the KMC combination...Kite,Mynah, Crow! Well, at least there are more sparrows around in the suburbs now, that's really something...

And our BARN OWL conservation group is going ahead, and has fabricated nest boxes; now we will be putting them up in suitable locations...real estate construction in Bangalore is also, literally, for the birds!
