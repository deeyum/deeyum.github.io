The seat basks in the sunshine,
Looks down on the view.
With its lengthening shadow
It seems to invite you....


To sit and spend quiet minutes
Musing...and thinking
Of various topics
While the sun is sinking.

As twilight sets in
And dusk gathers force,
You will leave the seat....
But peace of mind will be yours.
