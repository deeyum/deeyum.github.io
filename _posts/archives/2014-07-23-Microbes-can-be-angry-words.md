My friend Pallavi Singh wrote on FB:

"Aahna, upset with me over something, said with intense emotion - Mamma, you are a GERM!!!!
I suppose our paranoia over children catching infection is sooooo great, they believe these micro-organisms are truly abhorrent! I had a tough time stifling a chuckle!"

To this, a friend of hers. Avi Pratap Singh, responded with some verse from Ogden Nash:

"A mighty creature is the germ,
Though smaller than the pachyderm.
His customary dwelling place 
Is deep within the human race. 
His childish pride he often pleases 
By giving people strange diseases. 
Do you, my poppet, feel infirm? 
You probably contain a germ."

So ofkose I decided to do my own Nashery:

"When for angry denouncement
She looks for a suitable term,
Yet feels it too rude
To call you, outright, a worm...
She's understood now, that
She can say,"Oh,you GERM!"
