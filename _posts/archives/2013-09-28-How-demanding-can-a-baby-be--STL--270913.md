I was playing with him, putting a small "tika" on his forehead, before his bath. He batted my hand, and the eyebrow pencil's mark fell on the space between his nose and mouth. I simply fell about laughing...and very wickedly, completed the unintentional mustache before I took him in to his bath,  and washed it off.

I should be very contrite...my poor litte imp...but I simply cannot stop loffing!
