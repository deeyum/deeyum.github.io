Those two overused words: Thank and You.

Your affection and your care comes through, and that's what matters to us right now.

Yes, Anjana is here, and Derek is arriving on Friday night (managed some time off from his demanding job!) so we will be together for a while....oh, it's going to be a long road to the new and altered normality, but we have started walking on it now.

 I have been singing out loud a lot (we only had close friends and relatives yesterday and I was able to sing) and that has helped ME a lot. My common-sense husband, whose lack of emotion (actually, lack of display of it) I sometimes deplore, has been a rock since he came back. 

I am sad, but also realize that I have so much to be thankful for....
