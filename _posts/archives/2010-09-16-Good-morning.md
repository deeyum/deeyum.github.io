Of course it's a good morning...I am off to Lalbagh with 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/550933.html"> Karen, Paul, Eliza, Sylive, and Lupin Amstutz </a>

just now!

Meanwhile...when I call St.Louis, Vonage does a transcription of the voice mail messages I leave.

The message I left this time was, "Hello, I've got a cheque from ABC Bearings, where do you want me to deposit it? I don't want it to be sitting around for too long. I am going to sleep now and am meeting somebody at Lal Bagh. OK, bye."


The transcription was, "Hi Joel,  I have received a check  from ABC Betty that you wanted me to deposit it. I don't want you to be sitting around for too long. I'm still and have somebody to love bug. Okay. Bye " 

So, I am off to Love Bug now, for a very good morning!
