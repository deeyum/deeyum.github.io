<LJ user="shortindiangirl"> asked <LJ user="itsalouwelylife"> to get GD some baby underwear. She called back,  saying that baby underwear tends to have....er... crappy messages on it. 

We  figured it couldn’t be too bad, and asked her to get it anyway. She read one out.....

“I am enjoy boy”.


I still remember the one I bought for A, all those years ago, which said, "Haste Makes Wsste"...right across the seat of the pants!
