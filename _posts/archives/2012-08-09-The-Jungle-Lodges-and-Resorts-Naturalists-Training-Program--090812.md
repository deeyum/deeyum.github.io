Today was the first day of the Jungle Lodges and Resorts' Naturalists' Training Program, and I went to the JLR Bannerghatta property to meet all the participants. Some were known to me, otherws were new....but I had a great time, as usual. Alas, I could not get permission to stay over, so I had to leave...but sighting a scorpion, getting a great talk on the differences between beetles and bugs, enjoying the pouring rain, laughing and talking with the others...
