&quot;Journeys end in lovers&#39; meetings&quot;, goes the saying...but journeys also start with lovers&#39; partings! I watched two lovers (I don&#39;t think they were married) &nbsp;parting today, dealing with their joy in each other (no, I was not eavesdropping, they were in plain sight until the bus came to the bus stop!) , and their pain at parting...human emotion is so incredibly complex...I&#39;ve not seen anything as sweet as the smiles they gave each other. Each smile was a kiss, and the moisture in the woman&#39;s eyes at the end, hurriedly wiped away, spoke poetry to me. Love, in joy, in pain, is a magical thing.
