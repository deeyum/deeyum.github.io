LJ, for me now consists only of a handful of friends, and it's just sheer persistence that keeps me going, especially since it doesn't even "open" for me most days. But here's an appeal from the LJ team:


Is your Friends page feeling a little empty? Do you have friends who haven't posted in a while you'd like to hear from again? Invite them back, and you can both get some free Paid account time as a bonus!

Our new Remember LiveJournal promotion lets active members like you send their long lost LiveJournal friends an invitation to return. If they accept, both you and your friend will receive a free month of Paid account time! You can earn 1 month of free Paid account time for up to 5 people who Remember LiveJournal, for a total of 5 months of free Paid account time. After that, you can still keep inviting friends, and they'll still get their free month of Paid account time. A special gift will be given to the person who has the most friends Remember LiveJournal, we'll be giving them a permanent paid account!

To start inviting old friends go to http://www.livejournal.com/remember/ while logged in to your LiveJournal account, and enter your friend's username. We'll send them an email with a confirmation code (or you can copy/paste the link and send it to them directly). Once they accept, they just need to post an entry for you both to receive your free month of Paid account time!

Head on over to http://www.livejournal.com/remember/ to help your friends Remember LiveJournal!

Sincerely,
The LiveJournal Team.
