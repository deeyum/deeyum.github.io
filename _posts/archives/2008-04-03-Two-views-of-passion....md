I saw one flower a few days ago in the little park near my home and went to photograph it; I was rewarded by the sight of four; hopefully, many more will be blooming soon...I am not sure if they have been deliberately planted or are just growing there.

It's been, according to the newspaper, the wettest March Bangalore has had in...133 years! So here's "sky ocean" picture:

Am *intensely* irritated and am trying to cool myself down with all the pictures, will succeed soon. I must say, though, that for some time, I was wallowing in it, which is BAD.
