Apart from the sighting of the

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/724788.html"> Shieldtail </a>

Soma, Baljeet and I also spotted varied and interesting (always!)creatures and plants...

There was, for example, this beautiful little amphibian, posing on a rock:

<lj-cut text="some more living things"> 

I was a little worried that the number of birds we had spotted was on the lower side, but Soma, an indomitable spirit who does not let her rheumatoid arthritis get in the way of her birding, was very happy that she saw the

RUFOUS-TAILED LARK

for the first time:

For a while, we watched this crowd of

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIAS

both male and female, preening, and pecking around on the ground in front of the lantana bushes:

Let me show you, for once, not the bird as photographers finally manage to capture it, but as it is normally seen. The 

GREATER COUCAL

belongs to the pheasant/crow family, and it skulks in the most irritating way, amongst the foliage. So, all one usually sees is a flash of red-and-black disappearing into the trees, and then this kind of sight:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_4309-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_4309-1.jpg" border="0" alt="coucal 131010"></a>

It's a large bird, and yet manages to keep out of sight!

We watched many 

BLACK KITES

taking along nesting material to construct their homes:

A couple of butterflies added to my image pool, too; this

LEMON PANSY

posed for me...

Soma was quite thrilled with the

RED PIERROT

too, and said it was a lifer:

One amazing thing was this un id

CATERPILLAR
....it swung on a fine silken thread, and slowly descending, swaying the morning breeze, to the ground, where it went to earth under a pile of fallen leaves. Does anyone know what cat it is?

I pointed out the "potato plants" from the family

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant"> Solanacae or Eggplant family </a>

to them, and snapped the brinjal-like flowers


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_4316-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_4316-1.jpg" border="0" alt="potato flower 131010"></a>

And the red berries....

I'm closing with this lovely flower of a creeper that's probably some kind of gourd:

A very short but enjoyable trip to my favourite haunt!
