At precisely 9.00 AM (central time) on 29 April,2009, DnA's little daughter came into the world naturally. She is 20 inches tall and weights 7.124 lbs (3.14 kgs.). Mother and daughter are doing fine. Baby has a LOUD voice. :)

D's parents and A's aunt were able to see the baby, parents, and grandparents due to Skype video!

Happy Birthday...and may you have many more happy ones...
