When Jaysingh Morey from Mumbai requested my company to Nandi Hills, I was also able to invite Kiran Kashyap and Gayatri Rao along.

We left a little late and the sun was already up while we were at the base of the hill:

But as we climbed up, the clouds and the mist caught up:

The Nursery area looked like this:

The Pavilion:

The reservoir:

<lj-cut text="an interesting and satisfying morning"> 


Undaunted, we walked around in the nursery, looking for birds

Here's my salute to the place where I've seen some of the most beautiful birds in Bangalore:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15968855839" title="IMG_8306 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8605/15968855839_842886c893_z.jpg" width="640" height="404" alt="IMG_8306"></a>

The flowers were blooming, but we couldn't see too many birds..

in fact we couldn't see much, though this 

TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER

did oblige:

However, even in the mist, the

NILGIRI WOOD PIGEONS

were visible:

The 

ASIAN PARADISE FLYCATCHER

looked extra beautiful in the mist!

my friends delightedly followed the tail-flaunting fellow!

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/1113052.html"> Here </a>

is my post about the beautiful bird.

We found some Warblers in the hedge...it started like this,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16154553602" title="IMG_8361 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7520/16154553602_f8206711b2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8361"></a>

then we had a glimpse,

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15967863848" title="IMG_8362 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7554/15967863848_d3fcab43c8_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8362"></a>

and then we saw the bird!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15968000900" title="IMG_8364 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7527/15968000900_e077f82600_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8364"></a>

Taking pity on us, they finally did make short appearances in the open:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16153409101" title="IMG_8366 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7480/16153409101_122fe8176d_z.jpg" width="640" height="392" alt="IMG_8366"></a>

We were very happy to get the 

BLUE-CAPPED ROCK THRUSH

bathing (so were the Puff-throated Babblers and the Tawny-bellied Babblers, but passerby scared them off before we could photograph them.)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15992453260" title="IMG_8442 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7476/15992453260_26b42af2f3_z.jpg" width="640" height="413" alt="IMG_8442"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16153963446" title="IMG_8443 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7515/16153963446_95ccc0a9bb_z.jpg" width="640" height="453" alt="IMG_8443"></a>



A brief flurry of excitement about whether we'd got the Pied Thrush until we realized it was the Blue-capped Rock Thrush female.

The Tickell's Blue showed himself again:


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16177871441" title="IMG_8422 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7559/16177871441_e0b319fc53_z.jpg" width="640" height="435" alt="IMG_8422"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16178986152" title="IMG_8423 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/16178986152_2f54bfbd60_z.jpg" width="640" height="461" alt="IMG_8423"></a>

(sorry, I just cannot resist his beauty!..He reminds me of the Eastern Bluebird I see in the US!)



Nehru was lost in the mist in front of his Nilaya:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15968012220" title="IMG_8383 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7466/15968012220_74fbbc1e5d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8383"></a>

The liana in front of Nehru Nilaya is so beautiful!

I liked this abstract at the reservoir:

I turned this picture sideways to get the eye of the tree!

I also got a necklace of diamonds:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15969262019" title="IMG_8400 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8655/15969262019_38fcb1303c_z.jpg" width="640" height="511" alt="IMG_8400"></a>

Visitors were finding out that "rock-steady" may not really be so:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15993683129" title="IMG_8424 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7569/15993683129_17c3c2a9db_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8424"></a>


The mist finally cleared and we got our view from the top:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15969576247" title="IMG_8402 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/15969576247_73bafcce4e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8402"></a>

I found these tiny wildflowers growing on the rocks:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16155343985" title="IMG_8406 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8677/16155343985_a6fe030a83_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_8406"></a>

There were a lot of visitors by now, so not wishing to add to the crowd, we left.

On the way back, we found a Black Kite trying to pick up a Rat Snake, and stopped to photograph it. The bird, which had dropped the snake, had not come back, but it did appear to be a bird kill and not a road kill.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/16179026972" title="IMG_8469 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/16179026972_9491875c4b_z.jpg" width="640" height="423" alt="IMG_8469"></a>
