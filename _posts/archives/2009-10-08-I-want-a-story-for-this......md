Both days, on my way to Valley Green Inn in the Wissahickon area, I saw this poster:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7194.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7194.jpg" border="0" alt="041009 honey stop the car"></a>


I never could find out (it was on the road, and I could not ask either the cab driver on the first day, or Kusi on the second, to stop) what this was all about, but the possibilities are intriguing.

Can each of you come up with your story for this poster? Don't miss the dog in the illustration!

Looking forward to a very entertaining time of it...

My own simple-theory-to-begin-with:

There's honey for sale in the house behind the poster, and this is the way it's being advertised.
