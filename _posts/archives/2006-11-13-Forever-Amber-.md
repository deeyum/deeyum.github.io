....

This picture (taken, I think, by KM) also requires a large-size post, not the medium-size that I usually use.


It's a drop of resin from one of the trees at the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary....it's so very beautiful.....

Of course, on a literary level one now associates this both with Forever Amber, as well as with a pre-historic fly forever caught in the resin, from which dinosaurs can be cloned.....
