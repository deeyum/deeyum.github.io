A friend on INW wrote,in response to <a href="http://www.indianaturewatch.net/displayimage.php?id=79583"> this photo </a> that I posted :

    I guess this is what we in human lingo call - Deep skin cleaning, and waste all that money for some very questionable cream when the Rhino gets it all done for free and as far as my understanding goes have a far better and lustrous skin than we do :-)


what inspirational words those were. I promptly decomposed:


The Rhino has a lustrous skin;
The glow doesn't,however, come from within;
The tall egret and the hopping mynah
Are what makes its skin shiniah and finah.
But tell me--really--for two pins
Would you really exchange your skins?
Would you like a skin like a Rhino?
Why don't you say "yes"? Why "NO!"?
If your skin was cleaned by an egret
Would you really feel any regret?
I'm sure skin that's picked over by a mynah
Will be smooth and shiny as fine bone china!


I could go on like this for hours....Silly Verse Time!
