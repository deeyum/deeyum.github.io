This post is of NO interest whatsoever to anyone who is not interested in birds, so on to the next friend's post.....

And for those who are interested, I have posted such a variety of bird pics, that you need to look only when you have leisure. I realized that so many factors are conspiring against my posting bit by bit as I want to do, so am just listing out all tbe birds I caught, as I have to do a mammals post and a butterflies post and a Wildgrass post and a Shillong post and a.....

I think I should give up either photography or travelling...or posting!

OK, here goes, starting with the LESSER ADJUTANT STORK:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_4162.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_4162.jpg" border="0" alt="lesser adjutant stork 121208 central range"></a>


<lj-cut text="birds by the dozen here">


There were plenty of ASIAN PIED STARLINGS;must look out for them now in Bangalore, too.


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9322.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9322.jpg" border="0" alt="asian pied starling wildgrass 121208"></a>


This GOLD-FRONTED LEAFBIRD, so difficult to see in Bangalore, was jumping high in the canopy at Wildgrass:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9328.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9328.jpg" border="0" alt="gold-fronted leaf-bird wildgrass kaziranga 121208"></a>


We have the golden oriole in Bangalore, but here was the BLACK-HOODED ORIOLE:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9331.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9331.jpg" border="0" alt="black-hooded oriole wildgrass 121208"></a>


The WHITE-RUMPED SHAMA, that we sighted briefly in Valley School in Bangalore, was far more visible in Kaziranga:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9397-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9397-1.jpg" border="0" alt="white-rumped shama 131208"></a>

SMALL  BLUE KINGFISHERS are also quite common:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9878.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9878.jpg" border="0" alt="small blue kingfisher kazi eastern 131208"></a>


I got this DARTER (SNAKE BIRD) sunning itself when we crossed a bridge:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9431-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9431-1.jpg" border="0" alt="darter central range 131208"></a>

The water attracted a lot of waders, like this GREENSHANK:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9413.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9413.jpg" border="0" alt="greenshank 121208"></a>


This GREEN SANDPIPER, too, wandered along the riverbank:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9417.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9417.jpg" border="0" alt="green sandpiper 131208"></a>

Another lifer for me was the RED-BREASTED PARAKEET:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0237.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0237.jpg" border="0" alt="red-breasted parakeet 141208"></a>

I snapped this raptor, which my friend AMS id'd as a JUVENILE RUFOUS-BELLIED EAGLE:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9872.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9872.jpg" border="0" alt="juv rufous-bellied eagle?"></a>



Another Bangalore winter visitor, the SPOT-BILLED PELICAN, was around in Kaziranga, too:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9490.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9490.jpg" border="0" alt="spot-billed pelican taking off"></a>

I saw several PALLAS' FISH EAGLES, this one was taking some soft furnishings back to his home!


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9511.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9511.jpg" border="0" alt="pallas fish eagle getting nesting material"></a>


I was also lucky to see this beautiful raptor, the PEREGRINE FALCON:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9584.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9584.jpg" border="0" alt="peregrine falcon 131208 eastern range kazi"></a>


There were COMMON STONECHATS everywhere, too, but generally far away:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9623.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9623.jpg" border="0" alt="common stonechat 131208"></a>

One other old friend was the ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD:




<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0176.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0176.jpg" border="0" alt="oriental honey buzzard"></a>



The BLACK-NECKED STORK took fright, and flight:




<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0171-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0171-1.jpg" border="0" alt="black-necked stork in flight"></a>


This GREATER FLAMEBACK woodpecker was quite busy!

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9867.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9867.jpg" border="0" alt="greater flameback"></a>


We saw a kill, and next to it was a LONG-BILLED VULTURE, a bird that is endangered, and not easy to find in south India.

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9920.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9920.jpg" border="0" alt="long-billed vulture 131208"></a>


The BLUE-BEARDED BEE-EATER made a great multicolour subject!


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9777.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9777.jpg" border="0" alt="blue-bearded bee-eater"></a>


I thought of <LJ user="shivakumar_l"> when I saw these BAR-HEADED GEESE (which is what we call those who are heading for the pubs in Banglaore):


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9890.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9890.jpg" border="0" alt="kazi eastern 131208 bar headed geese"></a>


They made a lovely picture, flying:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9923.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9923.jpg" border="0" alt="bar-headed geese flying"></a>


Two WOOLLY-NECKED STORKS sat around:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9934.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9934.jpg" border="0" alt="woolly-necked storks 131208"></a>


This ALEXANDRINE PARAKEET sat too high for me to take its typical red spots on the wings:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9956.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9956.jpg" border="0" alt="alexandrine parakeet 131208"></a>


Our guide told us this was the STORK-BILLED KINGFISHER, which I had once had a glimpse of in Bheemeshwari when I went there with <LJ user="yathin"> ...I got a perfectly terrible shot of it, I remember, it was about 3 days since I had started using the 20D!....Here it is:



<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0038.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0038.jpg" border="0" alt="black capped kingfisher kazi e 131208"></a>


There was also a GREAT EGRET, I have learnt to tell the great egret from the intermediate one by the length of its eye near the end of its bill.


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9939.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9939.jpg" border="0" alt="great egret 131208 eastern"></a>


I enjoyed clicking the colourful GREY JUNGLE FOWL:

A very good sighting was of these SWAMP FRANCOLINS (our guide called them Grey Francolins, but the markings match only the Swamp ones)


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9948-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9948-1.jpg" border="0" alt="swamp francolin Francolinus gularis 131208"></a>


There were BRONZE-WINGED JACANAS, here's a juvenile:



<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9881.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9881.jpg" border="0" alt="bronze-winged jacana 131208"></a>


Now I am giving you the birds that I saw in the grounds of Wildgrass Resort in half an hour, while waiting for the safari jeep...

The RUFOUS TREE-PIE finally posed for me in Kaziranga after skulking in the bushes in south India and in Kanha too...


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9684.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9684.jpg" border="0" alt="rufous treepie 141208"></a>

This GREEN IMPERIAL PIGEON looked calmly at me...

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_9977.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_9977.jpg" border="0" alt="green imperial pigeon 141208"></a>


The GREY-HEADED CANARY FLYCATCHER was a first-timer for me:

<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0087.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0087.jpg" border="0" alt="grey-headed canary flycatcher 141208 wildgrass"></a>

The ever-present LONG-TAILED SHRIKE was making a meal of a beetle (I can imagine its wife telling it reprovingly, "You're hitting the beetle too much these days, dear." (I have posted a similar picture of a shrike devouring a beetle in my Tanzania post.)


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0077.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0077.jpg" border="0" alt="long-tailed shrike with beetle"></a>


This WHITE WAGTAIL was nodding about, tail wagging, along the emptied-out pool of the resort:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0081.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0081.jpg" border="0" alt="white wagtail wildgrss 141208"></a>

And one of the trees in the garden was just covered with these YELLOW-FOOTED GREEN PIGEONS!


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0100.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0100.jpg" border="0" alt="yellow-footed green pigeon 141208 kazi wildgrass"></a>

On a silk-cotton tree, this TREE PIPIT hopped around as I desperately tried to get a halfway decent shot:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0181.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0181.jpg" border="0" alt="tree pipit 141208"></a>

And in the foliage sat a VERDITER FLYCATCHER, which I have seen in Valley School!


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0185.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0185.jpg" border="0" alt="verditer flycatcher"></a>

Off we went on the safari, and we saw this ASIAN BARRED OWLET:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0192.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0192.jpg" border="0" alt="asian barred owlet 141208 kazi"></a>

Soon it was raptor time, and this GREY-HEADED FISHING EAGLE came into view (we saw several during our trip)


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0212.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0212.jpg" border="0" alt="grey-headed fishing eagle"></a>


Far in the distance sat an old friend, the CRESTED SERPENT EAGLE:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_0230.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_0230.jpg" border="0" alt="crested serpent eagle 141208"></a>

As I was making  this post, it turned 2 am, and promptly the BSNL server message went from "automatic" to "manual"...I could no longer send or receive anything. Well, I have covered the photographs of the birds of Kaziranga, but the birds of Nameri will have to wait...

Will be calling BSNL to complain...it's now 8.30am and still the connection says "manual", and it's my Vonage modem which is working now.

Part 2 (Nameri) will be posted shortly.
