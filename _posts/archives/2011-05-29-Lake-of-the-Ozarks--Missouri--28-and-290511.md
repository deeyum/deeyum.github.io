We're spending this (Memorial Day) weekend at the Tan-Tar-A resort in the Lake of the Ozarks:

Yesterday, we went to see the Castle ruins:

The ruins were quite impressive:

I went up close to the Water Tower, and the view from there was impressive, too:

Photography was indulged in, with monkey tricks:

the name of the game WAS to indulge:

Some folks like four wheels, some like two:

We all set out on a hike after lunch:

Watched a few birds along the way (is it possible to avoid this when I'm around?)


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_0246.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_0246.jpg" border="0" alt="un id bd 280511"></a>

This bird above is called the Eastern Phoebe, and it's similar-looking to the Eastern Pee-Wee, and that inspired me to versify:

If I were a bird
And needed a name that was impossibly twee
I'd still chose a word
...Or two...that was not "Pee Wee";
Because, you see
Someone might feel
The name is a deal
Too long...and just call me a "Pee".....
So...I'd rather be
An Eastern Phoebe....



Heard them singing, too:

Some moths were around, too!

The mist at the spring was awesome:

and so were the natural formations...this one is a natural bridge that spans two slopes:

None of us shopped, but if we'd wanted to, we could have gone to Ozarkland, which was modestly claiming to be a "fantastic gift shop":

We wound up with dinner at a Mexican restaurant, which had this lovely piece of wildlife:

Let me close with the most common insect here, the 

CICADA:

and the ex-Cicada:

We saw Muskrats and Otters and Red-eared Sliders (Turtles) as well as water snakes...and several deer, too.


More details...go to  my Facebook photos, (it's SO much easier to upload hi-res pics to FB and add the narrative!)

Let's see what today has in store for us...there's going to be fireworks in the evening on the lake.
