I found this a few days ago in the Mini-Forest:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_9912.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_9912.jpg" border="0" alt="tomato on pole mini f 080111"></a>


Can I have some nice, entertaining stories for the picture, please?
