Thoughts of how impermanent things can be, have been in my mind very much lately. 

But in their short-lived life, several things are so lovely!..for example, these two at Creve Coeur Lake were particularly beautiful:

and

Our life s like this sandcastle built by children on the sands of the lake...we take great trouble over it, but it doesn't last...

Never, never believe anything will last....nothing does....
