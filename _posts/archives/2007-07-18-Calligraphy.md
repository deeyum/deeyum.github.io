I love calligraphic images, and love the Islam calligraphy that is so intricate..but recently, I find a lot of good examples in the Hindu idiom, too. Here's a sticker I found at the back on a van near my home; the calligraphy is of the various names for Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Shiva and Parvati, who is the remover of obstacles:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9190033@N03/807548702/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1150/807548702_6ddd27c12f_o.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="vinayaka 120707 miniforest" /></a>


The names are (from the crown level,downwards, reading left to right):

gaN nAyak

kapil

hEramb

gaNEsh

vikat

vighnarAj

lambOdar

gajAnan

gaNAdhyaksh

gaNapathi

vakrathunt

Ekadanth

dhoomrakEthu

vinAyak

shoorpakarN

The name that is the form of the Mooshik, Ganesha's vehicle, at the bottom of the sticker, I can't make out properly....or is the name one more synonym for Ganesha? Would appreciate some help on this...

All names are in the Devanagari script, which is what Sanskrit and Hindi are written in.
