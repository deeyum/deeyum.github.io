Found this in a shop in Chickpet....

I just couldn't help wondering HOW they regulate the speed of the fan when it's running, and at the end, HAD to ask the shop-owner, Jayesh.  He gave me an explanation about lack of space elsewhere in the little, crowded shop, which included the words, "we don't change the speed of the fan." In that case...why have the regulator at all?

If they try to regulate the speed of the running fan, they are going to have  to go to....er...second-hand shops!
