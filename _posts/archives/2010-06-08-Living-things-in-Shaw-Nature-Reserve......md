Though we didn't, obviously, spot any earth-shakingly rare species at the Shaw Nature Reserve, what we saw kept us happy and going for a long time! Let me start with this image of the delightful

EASTERN BLUEBIRDS

sitting so companionably and greeting-cardly together!

A lifer for me was the

INDIGO BUNTING:

Here it is, singing:

Once again, soaring on the thermals, far above us, we got the

TURKEY VULTURE:

Far away, an

EASTERN PHOEBE

sat and watched us!

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6098.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6098.jpg" border="0" alt="eastern phoebe?"></a>

Some more lifers (id'd later by Danny Brown) were: this female

ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6071.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6071.jpg" border="0" alt="female rose-breasted grosbeak 050610"></a>

this male

EASTERN TOWHEE

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6068.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6068.jpg" border="0" alt="male Eastern Towhee 050610"></a>

this 

YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6066.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6066.jpg" border="0" alt="yellow-breasted chat"></a>


and this bird which is obviously some

FLYCATCHER

(though I can't say precisely which!)

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6012.jpg" border="0" alt="un id flycatcher 050610"></a>

All those birds were really far away so I have NO apologies about the quality of those photographs! Grassland birds seem to either sit far away or high up...not that other birds are much better....

On the way back, I got a quick shot from the moving car, of this

RED-TAILED HAWK

being mobbed by the 

GRACKLES 

after it did a swooping, stunning (but obviously unsuccessful)  dive-attack on a target that I could not see (probably a nestling)

Here's a juvenile Eastern Bluebird singing:

There were not as many 

BUTTERFLIES

as I would have thought, given that the glades were full of wildflowers. However, I managed to photograph this

GREATER SPANGLED FRITILLARY:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6092.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6092.jpg" border="0" alt="great spangled fritillary"></a>


this tiny 

BLUE 

(don't know which one, exactly)

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6007.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6007.jpg" border="0" alt="some blue b&#39;fly 050610"></a>

and this one, which, at home, would be the 

COMMON FIVE-RING

sitting happily on Malvika's shoe!

INSECTS

Casey, who is a native Missourian, has so much "casual knowledge" (he doesn't parade it, but he casually mentions facts!) about various things. I saw several insects in the stream that he id'd as 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dytiscidae"> DIVING BEETLES </a>

but I couldn't get a good photograph of them, so just click on their name to read the Wiki entry about them.

However, he did show me the fearsome fangs of this

BEETLE:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6166.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6166.jpg" border="0" alt="beetle and fangs 050610"></a>

I got this beautiful

DRAGONFLY

(don't ask me which one precisely!)

on the rocks near the stream:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5953.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_5953.jpg" border="0" alt="dragonfly 030610"></a>

we found these insects, which reminded me of the

COTTON-STAINER BUGS

at home:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6023.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6023.jpg" border="0" alt="cotton-stainer bug-like shaw 050610"></a>

They were on the flowering tree I've photographed below, too:

The variety of

PLANTS and WILDFLOWERS

was lovely to see. I have no time for all the ids, but here are some that I photographed:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6156.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6156.jpg" border="0" alt="colour in leaves shaw"></a>

well, these are

DAISIES

...even I know that!

This beautiful tree, which Malvika has id'd as the 

ALLEGHENY CHINKAPIN, was full of flowers, on which those mating bugs sat:

We saw only two 

MAMMALS

...the ubiquitous 

COTTONTAIL RABBITS

and right at the end of our visit, a

WHITE-TAIL DEER

from the car; we could not get a shot of the deer,

</lj-cut>

so here's a closing shot of the most delightful baby rabbit!
