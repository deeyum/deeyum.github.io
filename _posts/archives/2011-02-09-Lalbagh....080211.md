How could I let C and N go without dragging them over at least a little of Lalbagh? So off we went, as the sun rose:

<lj-cut text="short but enjoyable visit">

Here are Carbon and Nitrogen, at the south (Siddapura) gate of Lalbagh, with Matilda, <LJ user="idahoswede">'s cow, that goes everywhere with her:

The morning light was, as usual, lovely to see through the trees:

As the visit was such a quick one, we weren't really looking for birds; I showed them trees like the Monkey Puzzle and the Junipers and the mango trees dating from Tipu Sultan't time, but meanwhile, I couldn't help,er,spotting this

SPOTTED OWLET:

The ancient mango trees were also full of 

CHESTNUT-TAILED STARLINGS

high up in the canopy, feasting on the mango flowers:

The gnarled trunks of some trees were beautiful to see, the more so as they were festooned with bright green

ROSE-RINGED PARAKEETS:

some of them seemed to be actually making mangoes of themselves, too, curling in paisley shapes:

The park,of course, is a haven for the very common birds; at one place, it was a flock of

BLUE ROCK PIGEONS

feeding busily on the seeds and breadcrumbs scattered for them:

and at the lake was a murder of crows, sipping water:

I caught sight of this shoot from one of the Royal Palms:

We found some rare blooms, too. One was the

JADE VINE

with its wonderfully-coloured and shaped flowers:

We saw what Carolyn said might be called the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_plant"> Shrimp Plant </a>

 and it had wonderful balloon-like blooms:

I then saw what appeared to be the largest plantain flowers I'd ever seen, and stepped up close to have a better look. These plants were called "Crown of Thorns" (Euphorbia Milii)...but certainly, the wiki entry doesn't match it at all...so I still think I was looking at some variety of plantain or banana plant. Here's the flower, it was a gigantic version of the banana flower:

Here are the infloresences inside each "petal", which, in the usual banana flower, are shorn of their pistils and used as a vegetable:

We saw a few Cormorants on the lake, but had to hurry home, so we left Lalbagh to the trees and to the morning light filtering through them:
