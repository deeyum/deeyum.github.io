If I can't do something myself, and get someone else to do it regularly for me...and it gets done regularly and well...it stands to reason that I should respect the person who does it for me. Right? Wrong.

In India, the upper castes cannot clean their own waste, and need someone else to clean it and take it away for them...and scorn the people who do that. Yes, even today, this is mostly true.
