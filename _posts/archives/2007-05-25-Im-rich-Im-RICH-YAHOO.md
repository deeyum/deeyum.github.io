And why haven't they asked me for my credit card no so that they can shovel in all this money into my account...?

Also note, "sucess", "remmitance"...they are so economical with their consonants, but are willing to give me so much money.

Hmm, Mrs Amelia Hunts. I am sure she Hunts...diligently, for people who will respond to this!
