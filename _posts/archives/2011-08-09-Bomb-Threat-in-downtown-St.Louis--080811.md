Yesterday, near the downtown area (very close to the Gateway Arch) where A works, someone spotted a small strolley, and it was treated as a bomb threat. (A took the  two photographs from her office window.)

Here's the strolley, isolated by police tape:

She said that a robot, just like the one I'd photographed and taken this video of in 2009 (this was part of a police-meets-the-public program at the Loop)

Was used to investigate the suitcase.


But a protective-suit-clad bomb expert investigated the bag...

I can only imagine how stressful and dangerous such a job must be...never knowing what it is that one is going to approach, laying one's life on the line each time....


Finally, the bag was opened...and, A says, they found toothpaste and underwear inside!


Here's D's comment on who might have left that bag:

"A disgruntled citizen, no doubt, who is annoyed at having any tax dollars (that they may or may not have paid) going towards "wasteful" projects.  Well, what a waste if a bomb were actually to blow up the bridge... how many more tax dollars would be spent repairing that?  But, I digress.  It's just one theory.  Another one is that somewhere there is a person trying to check their bag at the airport before getting on a plane and thinking, "hey, where's my suitcase??  Oh... shit!!!"  And he might just be lucky enough to see one of the terminal TVs showing CNN, showing live coverage of a bomb squad blowing up his suitcase." 


That's hilarious...but the next bomb threat may not be so....the Bomb Squad can never afford to relax.
