Found this lovely name on a restaurant signboard on the way back from Kaziranga...

Wonder what the paradox could be? That the food is good in spite of the name?


I am suffering from a paradox right now...am surrounded by devices which OUGHT to make it easier for me to post, to communicate, and share my photos...but they don't!
