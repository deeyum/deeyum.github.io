Though I had planned to go on the Bird Watchers' Field Club 4th Sunday outing to Sarjapura, several friends persuaded me to go to the Zoo area instead (which is, anyway, a great favourite with me!)...so off we went in the cool, cloudy, misty morning. 

ALL of my photos are on the Facebook album, 

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150277690553878.345134.587058877&amp;type=1"> here </a>

...but here are some of the things we sighted, and I captured.


After meeting up (the usual starting point is Shoppers' Stop, on Bannerghatta Road), we had our mandatory chai stop at the Bannerghatta Police Station (not AT...near!) and when we started our trail, the very first bird to greet us was this

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIA

Alas, we were not allowed to go on the path towards the Butterfly Park, so we walked along the Hill View restuarant perimeter, and it was nice to see the mark of an elephant's presence:

You can see the human foot for size reference!

The monsoon has brought out the 

GIANT WOOD SPIDERS

all over the paths, and here's one variety, the

Nephila maculata

enjoying Sunday breakfast.


Another variety,


Nephila kuhli

also looked beautiful with its black body and orange-red legs!


Apoorva, Sanjeev's daughter, is very sharp-eyed, and spotted this "jigsaw" of

MILLIPEDES



<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6574-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_6574-2.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

in the ditch.


A little later, it was lovely to see two camp elephant calves, walking around, grazing, under the watchful eyes of their mahout:

Even when we wound up the outing and went for breakfast (our usual venue now is Upahara Banashree, near the NICE Road junction), we found a lot of interesting things just outside the restaurant, such as an almost-part-of-the-landscape Rock Agama, and these lovely

MUSHOOMS

Dr Sanjeev told us that these are called "art mushrooms" as very often, artists paint them and give them to visitors, in the UK!

In the grass nearby, we spotted these two mating Damselflies,

COROMANDEL MARSH DARTS:

When we dropped off Radha at her apartment complex, the road was strewn with flowers from the


AKASHA MALLIGE


(Indian Cork)

trees....

We returned home after a very pleasant morning, with memories of this pavilion in the Zoo area:
