One of my favourite melodious songs, from the movie

<ahref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guide_(film)"> Guide </a>

made based on 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guide"> novel by R K Narayanan </a>

This song seems a happy one.... but there's an underlying current of sadness in it...as "Rosie" is already moving on from the relationship that "Raju" has fought the world and given up a lot for. No matter that R K Narayanan hated this picturization of his novel. It is a haunting movie, with wonderful songs, showing the fleeting nature of love...especially in "forbidden" relationships.
