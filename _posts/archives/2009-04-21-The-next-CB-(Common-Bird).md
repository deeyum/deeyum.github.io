I didn't have to go anywhere for this one, s/he came and sat on the tree in the yard of the house almost opposite ours....I didn't dare to step out in my jammies, took it from my porch!

Here's my <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/178148.html"> old entry </a>  about the mockingbird...

Thank goodness, my photography has improved somewhat! :)

Here's more info about the bird on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mockingbird"> wiki entry </a>

Waiting to see a RED CARDINAL...soon....when I have a camera in my hand....
