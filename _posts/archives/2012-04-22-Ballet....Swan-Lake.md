I've watched Swan Lake being performed at Chowdiah Memorial Hall in Bangalore, performed by the Kiev Ballet, many years ago, under the aegis of ICCR, Indian Council for Cultural Relations(which seems to be a moribund organization now.)

I just watched this acrobatic version from China.

Of course, those of you who are new here may not know that I already have

One day, I'll go to Moscow and watch the ballet...one day...one day....
