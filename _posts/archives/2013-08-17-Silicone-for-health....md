While I give KP his cereal and vegetables, he's under the impression that anything near his mouth is part of the food. It's a struggle to get the bib out of his mouth, and some food into it. He's got a very strong grip...whether with his arms or his legs!

It's already clear that he likes his cereals, but has his preferences amongst the vegetables....he's NOT fond of carrots or beans. Peas and sweet potatoes are fine...but silicone seems to be the strong favourite, right now....
