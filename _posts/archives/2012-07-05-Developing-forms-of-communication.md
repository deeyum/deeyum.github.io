 I joined the cyber world during the time of email, and became an enthusiastic blogger; I still keep that up, but all the discussions, comments, debates and arguments that used to take place on the blogs, have all shifted to Facebook. No doubt I will soon have to learn another form of instant communication with the world at large....

I wonder what the next step will be?
