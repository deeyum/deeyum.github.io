SIGN IN A  BUSINESS  WINDOW,  IN FLORIDA!

"WE WOULD  RATHER DO BUSINESS  WITH 1000  AL QAEDA TERRORISTS THAN WITH ONE SINGLE  AMERICAN SOLDIER!"

This sign was prominently displayed in the window of a business in Florida

... and you are probably outraged at the thought of such an inflammatory sign.

However,  freedom of  speech is perhaps one of our greatest liberties.

And after all, it is only a sign, right?

You may ask :

"What kind of  business would dare post such a sign?"

Answer: A Funeral Home

(Who  said morticians had no sense of humour?)
