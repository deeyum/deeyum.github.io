Let me start with a beautiful bird...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/11502484196/" title="DSC05338 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/11502484196_aa3a384484_z.jpg" width="640" height="394" alt="DSC05338"></a>

Field report to the bngbirds egroup:

It was almost exactly three years to the day since I had been to Makalidurga.

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/759866.html"> click here to see that visit </a>


Since we read the egroup report about the flurry of birds at Makalidurga, we decided that we'd visit again, and in the chilly dark hours of Sunday, we dilly-dallied perhaps a bit too much,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/11507112514/" title="DSC05139 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7301/11507112514_20a40562ea_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC05139"></a>

Dilly-dallying for MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop).

<lj-cut text="plenty more if you want it">

 so that we finally got to Makalidurga (the Gopalaswamy temple area) only around 8.15 am after a leisurely breakfast at Dodballapur.

Grasshopper, Makalidurga.


Though we cannot claim that bird sightings overwhelmed us, the birds that we did sight were very rewarding, and we watched several for a long while. Silverbills gathering nesting material; Rufous-tailed Larks foraging on the rocky path; Kestrels hovering; two Sirkeer Malkohas which gave me an exclusive sighting...so went the list of birds, and we were quite happy to soak in the wonderful scenery and the cool, bracing weather as well.

Prashanti Express, Makalidurga.

We took a look at Gunjur Lake, as well, but it seems in a very dried-up state, and by the time we got there (nearly noon) there was no activity at all. 

We decided that having come all this way, we would go to Nandi Hills as well. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/11502619983/" title="DSC05299 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2855/11502619983_91ebfa26e6_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC05299"></a>

Nandi betta.

We stopped at the base for lunch.

Lunch

Old pavilion at Nursery area, Nandi Hills.

My advice to anyone who is thinking of visiting Nandi Hills in the evening during this holiday period is simple, and consists of three words. Do not go.

The crowds were quite impressive, and I joked that instead of "birding" or "buttering" we would have to go "peopleing".  In spite of this, the Nursery area, where we spent most of our time, and the Nehru Nilaya area, did not disappoint.  Olive-backed Pipits, Blue Rock Thrushes, Verditers, one  male Asian Paradise Flyacatcher which Santosh captured in the course of changing from rufous to white... we wandered around, quite content with what we saw, and had a very pleasant time.

Almost done!


Thanks to Santosh for putting the bird list together.  The Blue-faced Malkoha was rather doubtful, so it's been left out.

The kiss, Nandi Hills

To these I have to add,  Kite, Common; Kite, Brahminy, Pigeon, Blue Rock, and Warbler, Booted (yes, yes, the eyebrow was there.). There was also the lone Olive-backed Pipit foraging in the Nursery "cage". We did not see any of the  other Thrushes. Some of the birds  (eg Blue Rock Thrush)were sighted at both places. The Owlets that we usually see in the trees near  Nandi Multicuisine Restaurant (where the road begins, just past the T-junction) were absent. We also *think* we sighted a Black Eagle, but we are not sure.

Red-breasted Flycatcher,Nandi, 221213

Apropos of this, we were wondering if there have been Owl/Owlet sightings from Nandi Hills, as none of us could recollect seeing any such reports...can the experts throw light on this?
