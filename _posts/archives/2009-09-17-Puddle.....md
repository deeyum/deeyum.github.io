I just liked what I saw, so I photographed it...this was while waiting for <LJ user="mmk"> and Learning to come back from the Gateway Arch...

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_6103.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_6103.jpg" border="0" alt="cobbles, drain nd flower arch 080909"></a>



I liked the lines of the cobbles, the shine of the puddle, the splash of colours that the flowers provide...deep inside the puddle, the windows of the building look at themselves up above...
That's a very old cobbled street, and the building reflected in the puddle is over a 100 years old.
