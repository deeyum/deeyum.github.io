We've been having a discussion about the possibility of having a totally nomadic life today, and it made me think of how important electricity is in the lives of most of us...we can't get along for even a short while without it!

But there are the traditional pastimes that require no electricity, and I saw two of them while we were on the Bird Race...

I do love board games, and they don't need electricity, either! But...I'd be powerless without power, as a lot of my communications are online! Can you imagine a world without the Internet today?
