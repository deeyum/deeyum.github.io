A train pulls in (I can't say, "steams in", any more!) One journey is over...and another, soon to begin. For a brief while, many unconnected people will share a small space together...some of them will strike up conversations, others will remain blissfully unaware of how may others are travelling with them.

Several agencies swing into action; the train is cleaned, the engine maintenance done, the catering supplies unloaded and loaded, connections between the carriages checked, and so the long list goes...before the announcement that this train is about to go out, once again, ferrying its load from one city to another....

Meetings happen, partings happen. Someone said that a station is one place where emotions can still be seen in the raw. Happiness, sadness, or even loss as someone discovers a missing wallet, mobile phone, or even luggage....

Trains and stations are bustling places...train travel is still magical to me.
