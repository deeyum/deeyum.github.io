On Saturday, a sudden change of plan resulted in my forgetting to take MLC2 when I went to attend the wedding; and there, I found the bride's uncle, after the ceremony, taking pictures of a huge spider with a large egg-sac. I watched it, of course, but felt bad that I couldn't take photographs.

On Sunday, however, Madhu, Kusi and I decided that rather than go to Delaware to do some hiking, we would go to the same

 And....when we reached 

<a href="http://www.valleygreeninn.com/"> Valley Green Inn </a> , 

I went over to the tree where I had seen the spider, laughing at my own idiocy in looking for the spider again...and..there she was!

Amazingly, she didn't react at all to my presence, and sat, perfectly still; I don't know if this is normal behaviour for a spider with an egg sac...butI was thankful that she allowed me the time to observe her for a while.


You can see the very large egg sac in this picture that I took ffrom the side:

Could someone tell me what spider this is? She was a little larger than a golf ball...

Update: <LJ user="charleshaynes"> has id'd it, correctly, I think, as a

Thank you, Charles and Debbie! :)
