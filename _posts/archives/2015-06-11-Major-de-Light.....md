I took her to the public library, and she cuddled up to the teddy bear in the children's section.

She meaured her own height, too...

Very reluctantly posed in front of the reading frame:

At home, she wanted to hide and have her father "seek" her. Her idea of hiding, first in this way:

When I told her she could be seen, she retreated a little up the steps.... with the light casting her shadow before her!

Finally, here she is, watching the "chainyyA chainyyA" video...

Here's the video (the song has no causal connection with the movie, but made it a hit!)
