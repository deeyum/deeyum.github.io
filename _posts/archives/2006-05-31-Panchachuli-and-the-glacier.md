This was the view from the Zara Resort, where we stayed in Munsiyari, a town at the northeastern tip, hardly miles away from the Tibetan (Chinese) border on one side and the Nepalese on the other. This was the first time we had seen a glacier...its beginning can be seen on the left-hand-side of the picture.

Until I learn how to post-process, I will be posting the pics are they were taken by Mohan. He has been pleasantly surprised, though, by the number of compliments he has been getting so far!</P>
