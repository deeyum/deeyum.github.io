Listen to my very talented nephew, Rakesh Raghunathan:

<lj-embed id="1059"/>


Apart from his great musical talent, he also runs a take-away wrap business, called Petawrap (mostly vegetarian, I think)in Chennai, with a chain of outlets, and runs a cookery show on one of the TV channels...all very successfully!

A versatile guy...and a very likeable person, too. Rakesh...your nickname is "Rock"...and you rock!
