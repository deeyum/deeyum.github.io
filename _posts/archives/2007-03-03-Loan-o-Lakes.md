Are you worried that there may be water shortage? Do you feel concerned that your home may soon be in an arid area? Don't worry. Help is at hand. No guarantors required...35 to 50 lakes will be loaned to you....by ICICI Bank....

Here's the poster at

I could also use some repayment "tenors" on my present bank loans, or be one myself...I can sing instead of paying back in cash!

I had heard, in the US, the term, Land O' Lakes...but this is the first time I have heard of Loan O' Lakes!
