Vince Eitzen was DS' grandfather. Marilyn, his grandmother, left for Florida today...and was talking about her first husband (he was the first of her 3 husbands.)  He must have been an amazing guy...

(She's certainly quite amazing.. she flew from Florida alone, and back, and spent each day with us, especially a long day at the Zoo!)


Near as I can tell, Pappy/Vince appears to have invented the digital preset timer as we know it. Just think of the daily applications...microwaves, ovens, sports, wow!

Also, (see 3rd link), an automated, on-line (telephone) ordering system...he was way ahead of his time!

I cannot think, ever, of being able to invent anything, and the creativity required for this is beyond anything I can even dream of!

And...how interested he would be, if he were alive today!
