Received a wide selection of cheeses from <LJ user="shortindiangirl"> through <LJ user="oldhen">.....getting the other things organized. Crackers, boards on which the cheeses can be displayed, cheese knives, other short eats, flowers to brighten up the home....hope to be surrounded by friends tomorrow night. Tonight is the building party which I hope to enjoy thoroughly!

Grover's La Reserve, Sauvignon Blanc, some Rose wine....and some fruit juice for anyone, like me, who doesn't drink wine.

Went for a long walk in the sunshine and cold weather....did I mention, I LOVE walking??

Here's hoping that everyone is as happy throughout 2006 as I am right now...!
