I got a message from Flora Williams, and since I wasn't able to guage whether it was "genwine" or not, I replied, and asked her for more details. Now...you evaluate, from her reply:

<lj-cut text="Floral reply">


"I am Miss Flora William,24yrs old from Freetown Sierra-Leone,the only child of Late Dr.David William who was killed by rebels when war broke-out in my country but my friends used to call me Miss Hope and i really love the name because i have hope that one day, i will be free from this place.I lost my parent and relatives during the war, but through the help of the UNITED NATION (UN) I was rescued and brought to Dakar Senegal refugee camp together with other surviving people.
 My hobbies are,Swimming,dancing,cooking, meeting people, going to social activities, and also i like listening to good musics .I Will like to know more about you,your likes and dislike,your hubbies and what you are doing Presently. I will tell you more about myself and the main reason why i contacted you in my next mail.
   As i told you earlier I am staying in a refugee camp.Staying here is more like a prison because we are restricted from doing or having some certain things here in the camp. This Refugee Camp is headed by a Rev. Father peter Johnson. He likes me so much to the point he call me his daughter,I do make use of his office computer to send email and i only enter his office when he is less busy. i wait to hear from you soonest.
kisses Flora William"
