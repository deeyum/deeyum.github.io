There are, it seems, times when violence pays. If bandhs were totally peaceful, normal people might be tempted to go to work or go about their business as usual. But if there is the fear of violent incidents, everyone tends to play safe, and so the bandh is claimed to be a "total success"...today, a certain section of people (politicians, who else, and their minions) &nbsp;can bring a city to a halt at will...what a sad state of affairs.
