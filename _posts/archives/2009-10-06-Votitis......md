The answer to 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/590445.html"> Votzit </a>

is that...

Chandan and <LJ user="beast_666"> were spot on.

I was trying to take this photograph from the back seat of Kusi and Madhu's car:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_7191.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_7191.jpg" border="0" alt="lights,leaves,man 041009"></a>


Don't ask me why, that image....lights, leaves, and the man....appealed to me very much, with the backlight  (yes, <LJ user="shivakumar_l">. So I clicked it.

Then, when I tried to get just the traffic light against the greenery, the camera focused on the dust particles on the windshield, and blurred the light...and the lovely abstract is what I got!

I have had  SO much fun with my MLC, and now MLC2, I must say. Perhaps I don't produce the best photographs...but I am sure I enjoy my camera as much as 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghu_Rai"> the best of photographers </a>

...and am not bothered about technical or artistic excellence!
