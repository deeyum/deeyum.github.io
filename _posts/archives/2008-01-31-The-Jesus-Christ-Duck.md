I have posted some pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/20401428@N08/2058771071/"> a pelican landing on the water </a>  where it looks as if it's walking on the water...but yesterday I did really see a Jesus Christ Duck!

That duck walked along comfortably on the layer of ice over the lake, and when it felt it had enough, broke the ice with one webbed foot, and started swimming!

And..I dedicate this post to a dearly loved Duck...
