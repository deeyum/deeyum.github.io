Very long post, read only if you have some leisure.

I do love my country, which often has its flag represented in unique ways:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8774.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8774.jpg" border="0" alt="india flag star 131109 myl"></a>

And I like walking through its cities.

Each city in India is quite distinct from the other; not for us the bland homogeneity of a skyscraper downtown and sprawling suburbs...I find Indian cities totally fascinating.

Like all Indian cities, the architecture in Chennai is an often astonishing mixture of old and new idioms, which are radically different from each other. It's fascinating to watch...and there are also the this-es, the thats, and the others as I walk. I decided to take my MLC for a walk, too...and we went together, through a few roads in 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylapore"> Mylapore (town of the peacock), now called Thirumylai or the place of the divine peacock </a>

<lj-cut text="walk with me through Mylapore">

Here's the "Kutchery Road" sign...this was named, I think, after some ancient courts (kacheri) that used to be there, and not after Carnatic music concerts:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8725.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8725.jpg" border="0" alt="catchery road sign 131109"></a>

Vegetable sellers do brisk business as the shops open by 6 am:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8704.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8704.jpg" border="0" alt="veg sales r h rd 131109"></a>

The newspaper vendors gather together to sort out the papers (and add those hundreds of paper leaflets advertising everything from educational courses to weight loss gyms)

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8707.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8707.jpg" border="0" alt="newspaper vendors 131109 luz"></a>


Turning into this ancient road is the stuff of...well...romance, even for a tailor!


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8719.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8719.jpg" border="0" alt="romance tailor myl 131109"></a>

This orphanage operates out of an old dilapidated building, which yet has lovely trees:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8718.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8718.jpg" border="0" alt="ashraya illam orphanage K rod myl"></a>

This shwEthAmber ("clothed in white") Jain temple is itself clothed in white, and follows the typical Jain temple architecture idiom:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8713.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8713.jpg" border="0" alt="jain temple katcheri rd 131109"></a>



"Crude" or "country" "drugs"....that is, "nAttu marunthu" in Tamizh...medicinal herbs and roots, sometimes very esoteric, have been sold this in this shop for at least forty years to my certain knowledge, because I have gone there as a young girl with my aunt to buy soapnut seeds for washing my (then very long and luxuriant) hair...

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8717.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8717.jpg" border="0" alt="131109 dubba chetty shop"></a>


In fact, "dabba chetty kadai" (shop) has become a kind of generic term now, to mean such a herbs-and-roots shop!

There are some old gems of facades, like this lovely monkey top:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8712.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8712.jpg" border="0" alt="old monkey top 131109 k rd myl"></a>

This one seems to be for distressed and working ladies (perhaps it comes to one and the same thing? :D )


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8722.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8722.jpg" border="0" alt="ashraya distressed and working ladies"></a>


The architecture of the Mylapore Police Station is also not bland:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8709.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8709.jpg" border="0" alt="myl p s catcheri road"></a>


I caught this picture of the old idiom and the new style, cheek-by-jowl:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8721.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8721.jpg" border="0" alt="old and new architecture myl 131109"></a>

I turn into Santhome High Road, now called Kamarajan Salai (kAmarAjar sAlai)




<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8738-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8738-1.jpg" border="0" alt="kamarajar salai santhome high rd"></a>



 and at the junction is the "dreaming spire" of the beautiful 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Thome_Basilica">Santhome Cathedral Basilica </a>:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8726.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8726.jpg" border="0" alt="santhome basilinca"></a>

Here's the nave, with the stained glass behind it:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8730.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8730.jpg" border="0" alt="nave in santhome church 131109"></a>


here are the pews, with the congregation:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8731.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8731.jpg" border="0" alt="pews in santhome church"></a>

In Mylapore, I find this contractor doing very good work, cleaning the garbage:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8732.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8732.jpg" border="0" alt="neel metal fanalca garbage"></a>


The quality of life for the urban poor,however, remains very low...here's a cycle-rickshaw (a very eco-friendly method of local transport which we ought to re-introduce to our cities!)-plying family....that baby is  as pure and innocent beloved ...and as poor...as the One lying in the manger in the nave of the Basilica.


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8723.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8723.jpg" border="0" alt="baby on footpath 131109"></a>


Near, and at, of the junction of Kamarajar Salai and Dr. Radhakrishnan Road (earlier, Edward Elliotts Road) are the Madras Lighthouse (yes, I have been to the top!), and the very beautiful heritage buildings of the Inspector-General of Police, respectively:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8745-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8745-1.jpg" border="0" alt="lighthouse and police bldg marina 131109"></a>

The I.G's Office (as it is called) building was saved from demolition by concerned conservationists, proof that sometimes citizens' wishes do prevail.


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8823.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8823.jpg" border="0" alt="I G office 171109"></a>


In the compound of the building, police constable exercise in the early morning:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8739.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8739.jpg" border="0" alt="police exercise marina"></a>

<a href="http://wikimapia.org/1133416/Queen-Mary-s-College"> Queen Mary's College </a> is another magnificient campus at that junction; the buildings are in a sad state of decay, though...here's one of them,you can see the solidity of the structure:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8746.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8746.jpg" border="0" alt="131109 old bldg queen mary's"></a>


I then turn into Dr. Radhakrishnan Road, and find the Mylapore Fire Staion:




<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8747.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8747.jpg" border="0" alt="mylapore fire stn 131109"></a>

And a little later, the pavement is blocked by a roadside temple; the architecture is generic:


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8759.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8759.jpg" border="0" alt="pavement temple 131109"></a>

In another nondescript building, this woman practices her oral hygiene...

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8754.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8754.jpg" border="0" alt="brushing her teeth 131109"></a>

Further down lies the weird Greco-Roman mishmash of the 

<a href="http://ekikrat.in/City-Centre-Chennai"> City Centre </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8823.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8823.jpg" border="0" alt="I G office 171109"></a>


with 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin"> gryphons </a>

on the roof are part of the mishmash 



<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8758.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8758.jpg" border="0" alt="griffon on city centre rkrd 131109"></a>


I wonder why they didn't think of adding 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yali_%28Hindu_mythology%29"> yALi </a>

instead?

Oftentimes, the exterior walls of a building bear political posters, with sycophantic praise of this or that politician:

a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8750.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8750.jpg" border="0" alt="waill politics 131109"></a>

The building of the 

<a href="http://www.csikalyanihospital.com/"> Kalyani Hospital </a>

(yes, I've been treated by a very crochety old Dr E V Kalyani myself!) still has lovely tiles:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8760.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8760.jpg" border="0" alt="kalyani hospital 131109"></a>


The architecture gets glassy:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8762.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8762.jpg" border="0" alt="tafe bldg 131109"></a>


And weird:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8763-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8763-1.jpg" border="0" alt="arihant nitco bldg rkrd 131109"></a>

But some of the gracious old bungalows, hidden behind the shady trees, remain:



<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8825.jpg" border="0" alt="171109 old house rk road"></a>



After this, I turn into Venkatachala Mudali St (VM St.)  and see the old 

<a href="http://wikimapia.org/634304/YMIA"> Young Men's Indian Association (YMIA) building gate </a>:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8769-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8769-1.jpg" border="0" alt="YMIA myl 131109"></a>

...then I turn back into P S Sivasami Salai (earlier, Sullivan Garden Road) .... where a plaque on the wall announces the opening of a "roadside park" by our Chief Minister, and all I can see is the trash can...


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8779.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8779.jpg" border="0" alt="sAlai Ora poongA! myl 131109"></a>

watch women carrying headloads as a matter of routine...

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8782.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8782.jpg" border="0" alt="131109 myl headloads"></a>

See that in spite of everything, there are plenty of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem"> Neem Trees </a>


<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8778-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8778-1.jpg" border="0" alt="neem tree myl"></a>



and gardens which still have jasmine (this variety is called  nithya malli in Tamizh) on their gates, scenting the air:

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8777-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8777-1.jpg" border="0" alt="nitya malli 131109 myl"></a>

</lj-cut text>

Think about the beauty of seeing a small temple, that's traditionally built under a spreading young

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_fig"> Peepal Tree </a>

<a href="http://s562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/?action=view&current=IMG_8776.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i562.photobucket.com/albums/ss67/pugaippadam/IMG_8776.jpg" border="0" alt="temple under peepal tree 131109"></a>

...and make my way home....
