I have watched several TV series that were seminal to me...which shaped my thinking, and expanded my mental horizons. Of late, no one seems to know much about them, but I would like to disinter, from the past (and the ever-present internet!) one of my favourite series, "The Ascent of Man".

Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_of_Man"> here </a> for the wiki on the series.

Here's a video of the first in the series, "Lower than the Angels".....

Be warned, it's a 52-minute clip...but unlike me, you don't have to wait for it to come on TV, you can watch at leisure. 

I didn't always agree with Bronowski's words or ideas, but the series did make me think.

Do let me know how you liked this one!
