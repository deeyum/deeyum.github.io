The sun starts dipping towards the west...

The clouds start drawing in..

As the sun sinks, it's as if the trees are on fire:

Even as the fire sinks down, it can be seen through the trees:

Slowly, the fire dims into dusk:

Even while the sun was above the horizon, the moon had made its appearance...

And as night fell, it gathered light to itself, to reflect it and shed moonlight in the skies...
