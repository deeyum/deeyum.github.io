Here's the scene that met my eyes as I walked into <a href="http://www.holidaymakers.in/packages/hillstations/yercaud-shevaroys.html"> the Shevaroy's Hotel </a> , the venerable hotel in Yercaud, that has extensive grounds, majestic trees, and an incredible ambience:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7593633@N04/440939392/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/178/440939392_73325c167b.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="Colours of Spring...Hotel Shevaroy's, Yercaud" /></a>

The pink-red is the Bougainvillea; the yellow is the Tabebuia; and the purple is the Jacaranda...and the green is...most welcome!

Any wonder that Spring is the time when Holi, the festival of colours, is played?

A great weekend getaway, within easy driving distance of Bangalore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yercaud"> Yercaud </a> (actually that should be written Erkad!) is still undeveloped and therefore, largely unspoilt. 

MUST go to sleep now.
