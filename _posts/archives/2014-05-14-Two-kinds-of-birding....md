The 

<a href="http://www.thevalleyschool.info/"> Valley School area </a>

is one of the favourite birding destinations in south Bangalore

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14155707692" title="DSC04211 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/14155707692_af7f3d0ba0_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04211"></a>

On two days, I was privileged to do two different kinds of birding there.

One outing, on 110514, started at dawn:

<lj-cut text="Different kinds of birding">

On the 11th, we started from Shoppers' Stop as a group of 9:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14158586824" title="DSC04154 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14158586824_252e3eb901_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04154"></a>

At the MCS, L to R: . Karuna, Janani, Siva, Varun, Aravind, Venkat, Ragini, Janhvi, yours truly, and Ganesh. 

As more friends joined us at the Valley, and we met Swethadri and Kamal Hari, the group swelled to 15!


On this outing, we walked the trail, actively looking for birds, such as this 

ROSE-RINGED PARAKEET

on the Silver Oak tree:

a

CRESTED SERPENT EAGLE:

the

WHITE-RUMPED SHAMA:

with many birds, we ended with this

HOOPOE 

on the path:

Of course, I like to see the trees and plants around, too. I could not id this tree:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14158478145" title="DSC04158 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/14158478145_d012aa4c94_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04158"></a>

The beautiful trunk of a 

TAMARIND:

and its tiny flowers:

the beauty of the 

GULMOHAR 

under which I sat for a while:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13971856118" title="DSC04173 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/13971856118_9f12dddb12_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04173"></a>

the petal of its flower:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14155686082" title="DSC04181 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7348/14155686082_187defeba6_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04181"></a>

Photography was an active pursuit, too. I am not lying, but the photographer is!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13971863340" title="DSC04201 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/13971863340_93f8a0af91_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04201"></a>

Ganesh is carefully documenting  an insect...

When one of us got a good shot, the others enjoyed it, too:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/13971847009" title="DSC04203 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7348/13971847009_a1d66f1c8e_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04203"></a>

There were quite a few butterflies, and I clicked this

DANAID EGGFLY:

Some of us wound up with brefus at

(Yashpal, extreme left, has joined us!)

This active seeking out of the birds is one kind of birding, and on this morning, we were very successful in our quest. We wandered over the bamboo thickets and liana areas, and a variety of bird sightings rewarded us.

On the 13th, it was just Rosita,

her son Mark, who's an excellent bird-spotter,

and me. This was in the late afternoon and evening...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14159320636" title="DSC04299 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5111/14159320636_55b50b3263_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04299"></a>



Once we reached the end of the path where the 

ABANDONED HOUSE

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14155450836" title="DSC04265 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/14155450836_ce11b9e9c0_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04265"></a>

(familiar to every birder, I would think, in south Bangalore...I'll make another blogpost about it. Thanks to Mark, I entered it and looked around for the first time in so many years!)

We just stayed there, not moving very much. The Banyan tree with the last of its figs was a kind of "bird Darshini (eatery)" for birds, so we just watched the birds in, and near, the majestic tree. Later, we walked around the abandoned house.

Mark didn't even take a minute to see the 

SPOTTED OWLET:

The 

JUNGLE BABBLERS 

kept us company:

This

ASHY PRINIA

its cousin, the Plain Prinia, and the Common Tailorbird, hopped through the undergrowth:

First one

LARGE CUCKOO-SHRIKE

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14175312711" title="DSC04269 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14175312711_fc89ca27de_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="DSC04269"></a>

and then two, delighted us:

The 

INDIAN LABURNUM

was in flower everywhere:

MISTLETOE

(Loranthus) grew on the nearby tree:

Looking carefully at the adventitious roots of the Banyan showed me

ANTS

farming the aphids:

This 

ROCK AGAMA

male, coming into his breeding colours, looked askance at me:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14198756853" title="DSC04293 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14198756853_7f13e46092_z.jpg" width="640" height="370" alt="DSC04293"></a>


The difference between the two kinds of birding is very marked. One means active walking around, seeking the areas where some birds are likely to be. The other means staying in one place, passively content with whatever birds show themselves. But both are intensely satisfying.

A large group vs. a very small one also makes a big difference to what one sees. In one, the chances of sighting the birds actually increase, if everyone is a careful birder. But a smaller group can be just as good. 

With both kind of birding, there is the happiness of learning from others, and being able to share a sighting...sometimes with everyone in the large group 

In the "active walking" mode, it's looking for the birds; in the "passive waiting" mode, it's about watching the birds that do appear, and soaking in the whole atmosphere.

 Morning birding and evening birding, too, have different kinds of light for photography (and sometimes even seeing the birds.)
