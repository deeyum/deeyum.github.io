Chandu Bandi, Job Joseph, and I went on a nature trail at the Valley
School yesterday (071212, Saturday), and the Valley never disappoints.
We managed to see 66 species of birds and several species of
butterflies, and we were also able to observe many things at leisure,
such as the courtship dance of one Coppersmith Barbet pair all over a
couple of trees, ants tending to aphids, wasps laying their eggs on
figs,  and a wasp collecting mud for her nest..

We were especially fortunate to see wasps laying eggs on the Ficus...I
*think* it was Ficus benghalensis, but I am not sure. Chandu pointed
out one wasp to me with a long ovipositor, and I managed to get that!

It was sad to see every water body completely dry.

We we managed to see several Flycatchers, and when, on the way home,
we overshot our turning to Bannerghatta Road, and went ahead on the
NICE road, we spotted several Painted Storks and Little Cormorants far
away from the road, at what we think was Begur Lake.  Overhead, we
sighted a Booted Eagle being mobbed by a Black (Common) Kite.

I have put up some photos on an FB album at
