Just this one tree will give my Indian friends an idea of the colours of the leaves during the fall season:

We drove to

(where we'd been, another winter to see the

and then, further, almost  to

This is the area where the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers meet.


The bluffs along the river looked very picturesque:

At several places, the fall colours were already flaming forth:

The foliage and the bluffs dwarfed the road and the cars:

Even nearer home, the reds (including the cars!) seem to be replacing the greens:

The blues, however, predominated on the river and in the sky...

But in the sky, too, blue gives way to red:

Sometimes the leaves are not red but an incredible pink:

There's pink on the ground, too, as the seasonal smartweed (thanks for the id, <LJ user="asakiyume">!) blooms across the grass:

Fall is associated with ripeness....the fat berries bear witness to this:

Mr and Mrs. Robin discuss their seasonal plans, as their red breasts shine brightly!

I saw this cross  set in the midst of the foliage!

It's a wonderful time of the year...the temperature is about 7 deg C, and it's so invigorating to walk in the mornings....! 

However, my next post will (probably) be from....home....!
