I found no trouble at all in being away from the telephone, the mobile, the internet for 8 days.....

But coming back and catching up with the mountains of mail, the messages, the news, the work...*that* is a different, and difficult, story!

Why can't everything sort of get done by magic when one is away, so that the euphoria of the trip doesn't evaporate quite so fast?!

Will be catching up with my friends' list....hopefully soon....
