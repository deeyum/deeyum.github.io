"Marapaachi Bommai (dolls)" is what I know them as. These wooden dolls have always been around, and at weddings, they are decorated and put on show as part of the wedding festivities. Here's a beautiful "couple" of Marapaachi wood, all dressed up at a wedding I attended last week:

 Don't miss the pleats on her sari, the plait of her hair, and his turban! They look proud to be representing the newlyweds! I wonder what name they go by in other languages...
