Thanks a million to <lj user="anushsh"> for sending me this wonderful jugalbandi concert...

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri">bAnsuri (large bamboo flute )</a>

 and

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jal_tarang"> jaltarang </a> 

(I don't know the equivalent in English...click on the link to know more about this very difficult musical instrument which is like a xylophone but played with bowls of water)

Listen to as much as you want or leave it on while you do something else...it's just over an hour long.

The first rAg is AbhOgi, a south Indian rAgA adopted by north Indian musicians, then comes mAlkauns (Karnatic equivalent=hindOLam), and then a small piece in pahAdi, which is not precisely a classical rAgA, but which comes from the mountains (pahAd=mountain), and is unmistakable.
