The King and Queen lay together
In the mud and grass.
In their separation from the pack...
The loss of their subjects...
They were still united
Perhaps, these royal Spades
Will dig up the ground
And sow the seeds
Of a new kingdom.
Togetherness is beautiful to see
In the middle of adversity.
In death they were not divided:
They seem to say
That if two heads are better than one,
Surely, four heads are better than two.
