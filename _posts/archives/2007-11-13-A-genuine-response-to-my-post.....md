In response to <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/309883.html">  my post on the "doctorate in numerology" </a> , I got this reply:


"Hello - a reader of mine sent me this page, and I felt compelled to respond! I am a British numerologist and author who has lived in the USA for the past 26 years. I can assure you that there is no such thing as a doctorate in numerology - and rightly so. We are only just touching the surface of this over-simplified subject matter, and only the very basics can actually be taught at this stage. From the perspective of someone who is trying to open this knowledge up and move more deeply into it, I find that anyone who claims to be a 'master' of numerology is actually someone who does not realize how little they know.
With love and all good wishes,
Christine DeLorey"




And I decided to check out Christine's website:

Well...I am still not convinced, but certainly I am not as sceptical as I am of practitioners who advertise on National Highway no. 4!
