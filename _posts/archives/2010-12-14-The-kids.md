When we say "kids", we generally mean human children, and often forget the ACTUAL kids! Here are two kids that I photographed at Pulicat Lake:

Just imagine huddling into that small space, and I don't know why the one behind wants his bum to stick up into the air, too!

When we came back from the boat ride, both kids were snuggled close to their mother, and could hardly be seen! It was also too dark to take a photograph. 

What will their future be? Will they be killed for meat? or will they grow up? I don't know...didn't want to speculate too much....
