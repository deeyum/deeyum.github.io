The

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Bridge"> Clark bridge </a>

which I thought was a suspension bridge but is actually a "cable-stayed bridge" (look up that link above!), is that amazing blend....a thing of both utility and beauty.

Here are the imagesI took of the bridge, that spans the Mississippi river:

It stayed in my mind from the time we followed D for his Century Ride and I felt happy that we were going there again for the fall colours.

Except for the shining gold-y finish, the bridge is somewhat similar to the

on the highway leading to Chennai.


I didn't realize it, but I love bridges.....I still don't know how they are built on a river-bed rushing with deep water....!
