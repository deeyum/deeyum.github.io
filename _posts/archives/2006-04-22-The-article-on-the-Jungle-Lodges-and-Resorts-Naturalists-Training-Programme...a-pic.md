It was nice to see that <LJ user="sainath"> has scanned the newspaper article I wrote:

It is sad that a good photographer hasn't been given credit for his photographs. But you can visit his LJ to see them (they look much better than on the printed page!)

The URL of the article still doesn't work  properly, it takes one to the March 17th issue of the newspaper....and there are some factual errors in the article which *I* certainly didn't make, for example, saying that I started an egroup to preserve wildlife, which is a hilarious statement!

Oh well...that's the real world! Put this behind you and get on with the next article!
