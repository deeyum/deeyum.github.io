Since Snehasis could not join our group for Skandagiri on the 6th, I wanted to take him to a birding spot that he had not visited before.

As I went down the stairs, I saw this dead

BAMBOO TREE BROWN

dead on the landing, and photographed it:

I then dropped it respectfully in the mud of a pot downstairs, little knowing that Rohit Girotra would want me to hunt for it the next day, as he wanted a dead butterfly for his collection, and didn't want to kill one like many others did. Alas, I could not find it!

Snehasis, Ruma and little Soham picked me up, and we headed out to Hoskote Lake.

<lj-cut text="more about the morning....">

In a residential layout close to the lake, we began our birding with this

PADDYFIELD PIPIT:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15963253576" title="IMG_6693 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8677/15963253576_c6a6c60b37_z.jpg" width="640" height="432" alt="IMG_6693"></a>

We came to the lake, and I found this raptor hiding in the reeds, and looking down into the water to see if it could get some breakfast...either fish or waterfowl.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801763690" title="IMG_6698 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7516/15801763690_f11e3a1795_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6698"></a>

I have not seen this behaviour by raptors before! I thought that they soar on thermals, and swoop down on prey that they spot from above.

Egrets were there in plenty...

and here's one!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15369398363" title="IMG_6702 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7573/15369398363_66e0d0ec59_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6702"></a>

It was an attractive "waterfowl"scape:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15369398593" title="IMG_6704 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8572/15369398593_a6a116aa18_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6704"></a>



BRAHMINY KITES

(this one's a juvenile) flew around, perched, 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15366780534" title="IMG_6712 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8561/15366780534_86112dc703_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="IMG_6712"></a>

preyed, and ate.

Hungry Bird!

<lj-embed id="1267"/>



A lone

SPOT-BILLED PELICAN

was perhaps all that was left from many more earlier in the season.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801638368" title="IMG_6724 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/15801638368_91fa9f15ca_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6724"></a>

We were also fortunate enough to meet several other birders, some of whom I knew, some of whom I was meeting face-to-face for the first time.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801766020" title="IMG_6740 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7512/15801766020_134a77cca8_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6740"></a>

I was as thrilled with the quite common

BLACK DRONGO

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15989020115" title="IMG_6742 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7530/15989020115_771ef28e58_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6742"></a>

as I was with a not-frequent sighting of the

INDIAN SPOTTED EAGLE:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15988356222" title="IMG_6745 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/15988356222_815f48101a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6745"></a>

Ok,that merits one more photo, you can see the nictitating membrane in the bird's eye, here:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15803027679" title="IMG_6746 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7468/15803027679_dd9c766cc5_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6746"></a>

While we looked at the bird, the bird looked at us!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801767690" title="IMG_6748 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15801767690_7b54a35115_z.jpg" width="640" height="424" alt="IMG_6748"></a>

I wandered along the bank of the kere,looking for other birds, and this Warbler played hide-and-seek with me!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987164481" title="IMG_6755 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7464/15987164481_324303116d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6755"></a>

Even when I got it, it refused to look at me.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15963373296" title="IMG_6765 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7569/15963373296_71a17bc75a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6765"></a>

Then I caught it...this is not a stretch of the imagination!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15369517193" title="IMG_6773 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7582/15369517193_cbf8ba63ba_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6773"></a>

and finally, after twenty minutes of patient tracking...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801884220" title="IMG_6776 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7554/15801884220_768ec88e32_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6776"></a>

Meanwhile, a

RED-VENTED BULBUL

was making a shake-and-stake meal of a grasshopper:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15989137795" title="IMG_6789 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8666/15989137795_35404260b1_z.jpg" width="640" height="455" alt="IMG_6789"></a>

Unexpectedly, along the reeds of the kere, I saw several

RED AVADAVATS (this one is a female)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987166251" title="IMG_6795 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7504/15987166251_dba15c9b7c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6795"></a>


We saw all three frequently-seen Kingfishers. The

WHITE-THROATED KINGFISHER

had decided to go to pot!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987166571" title="IMG_6800 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7463/15987166571_fd40f1b050_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6800"></a>

The 

COMMON KINGFISHER 

(which I call the Small Blue, it's no longer as common as it was)

was a sapphire treasure:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15803144939" title="IMG_6835 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8607/15803144939_d29d5c7f97_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6835"></a>


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15963375356" title="IMG_6828 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7537/15963375356_0cdacbf053_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6828"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987167841" title="IMG_6833 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/15987167841_6806e7e718_z.jpg" width="640" height="459" alt="IMG_6833"></a>

(I didn't get any of the Pied Kingfisher)

These

RED-WHISKERED BULBULS

rocked the scene:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15803143359" title="IMG_6809 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7488/15803143359_7ecbf02dcb_z.jpg" width="640" height="422" alt="IMG_6809"></a>


A

COMMON SANDPIPER

foraged in the shallows:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987167031" title="IMG_6816 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7557/15987167031_d7b005eee7_z.jpg" width="640" height="456" alt="IMG_6816"></a>


GREAT CORMORANTS

did their diving antics for food.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15803143809" title="IMG_6823 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7485/15803143809_6c0097efd1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6823"></a>

One 

RED-RUMPED SWALLOW

was pestering its parent for food, though it seemed quite grown-up to me!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15987169391" title="IMG_6857 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7501/15987169391_aa572e6c8e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6857"></a>

They were a beautiful study in "back and front"!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801762578" title="IMG_6861 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7498/15801762578_e1819663d9_z.jpg" width="640" height="386" alt="IMG_6861"></a>

As we left, a

JERDON'S BUSHLARK

sang us a goodbye song...

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15803420537" title="IMG_6870 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/15803420537_5f9c9d2b6c_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="IMG_6870"></a>

 a

BROWN SHRIKE

seemed to wink at us, too.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801762988" title="IMG_6872 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7477/15801762988_67ee1021e4_z.jpg" width="640" height="386" alt="IMG_6872"></a>

and a

BLACK KITE

in a Neem tree flew off.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15366902564" title="IMG_6882 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7470/15366902564_e5eb70d85f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6882"></a>

Ruma took Soham back to the car when he got peckish. He was an enthusiastic birder, and knows
many of the birds' names!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15963258516" title="IMG_6750 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7564/15963258516_50b6dca476_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6750"></a>


A stand of Datura (the fruit is very poisonous, and yet it is grown as an ornamental in the US!) looked beautiful.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15801757808" title="IMG_6764 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/15801757808_8d2c754c94_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6764"></a>


I watched some ants herding 

PLANT HOPPERS

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15989141055" title="IMG_6850 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7506/15989141055_b10a7bcc38_z.jpg" width="640" height="453" alt="IMG_6850"></a>


How often does one find one's name graven in stone (well, cement,at least!)?

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15989136595" title="IMG_6763 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7540/15989136595_53ba9e8ecf_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6763"></a>

We visited Debashis  Das and his wife on the way home, and in their 8th floor balcony, some

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIAS

were nesting!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15989142795" title="IMG_6883 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7569/15989142795_07e2455952_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6883"></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15988479662" title="IMG_6887 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8563/15988479662_f41af857a0_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6887"></a>

This was a real thrill for me, how I wish I could have birds nesting in my home!


</lj-cut>

Finally, we turned our back on the birds, and came home to breakfast.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/15963379776" title="IMG_6894 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8596/15963379776_9a3549759d_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_6894"></a>

 They turned their back on us, too...and a beautiful sight they make, from any angle!
