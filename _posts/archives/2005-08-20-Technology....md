Was thinking how amazing technology is, that it allows me almost daily, instant contact with a child on the other side of the world....this constant touch prevents me from feeling out of touch.

I wonder how previous generations of Indians, whose children went off abroad and could communicate only through expensive, infrequent phone calls, and delayed, 1 month-old news-bearing aerogrammes, managed...the children too would have felt isolated in the new county, and disoriented in the old when they visited after a few years...the Internet has changed all that. 

Amazing technology that is applied to everyday life...difficult to imagine that the same human brain which has thought of this can also contemplate murder and child rape and worse.
