The full moon of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi"> Holi </a>

festival where evil is burnt up.....

She  came up when we were visiting our friends.

She rose along the side of the buildings:

She told the children in the playground that it was time to go home:

She looked like a sandal-paste moon:

 But later, she looked more prosaic:
