Hmm...first of all, I got to spend some time on the Net yesterday and had posted about my visiting our fair rajdhani, Delhi...I had to use the "date out of order" option....oh, the entries had got mixed and I had to rectify them...

And here's what I posted today:

Karnataka State Tourism Discouragement Corporation...

Oh well....

I have been taking some pictures but finally, KM has ALSO decided to post to INW methinks...with the result that the camera was set to CR2 (the raw format for Canon) and the CF card, of course, got quickly full! Will download the pictures, and post a few of the decent ones (birding trips to both Okhla Bird Park and Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary)...and the campus where we stayed, the Anand Farm in Gudgaon, was a beautiful place with a wealth of birds. KM has taken the CF card today...tomorrow will be my turn!

Attended a Delhi wedding which, luckily, was not as glitzy as some weddings in that city can be...

Still wondering if the trip to Delhi was worth it...until I visited the home of someone I know, and found that their 13-year-old daughter writes beautifully. I tried opening a Live Journal account for her but the broadband connection in her home was down. She does nice anime sketching, too...a very creative child, I hope to introduce her in my LJ, at least, soon.....
