Today we hiked up the Glen Falls trail....and I just have the time to post these three images:


Apparently the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_thistle"> THISTLE </a>

 is a "noxious weed" here, but it still has beautiful flowers, and I caught one bee coming in for a landing to meet another bee....look at the wings buzzing at some umpteen beats a second!

Then, to make a change, I got a bee with a moth (or a butterfly, I don't know the id!)

And then I got the moth by itself, feeding off another wildflower....

I would never have got these if I had a DSLR and had to change to a macro lens (as obviously, KM would have had the landscape wide-angle lens on it!)...everything would have flown away by then! I do *love* the handiness of MLC2....
