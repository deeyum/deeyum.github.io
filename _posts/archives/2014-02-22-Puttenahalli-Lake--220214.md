Cultivar, Purva Heights, 220214.

Email to the Bird Watchers' Field Club:

On a sudden whim, I called up a few friends and we did a late morning ramble at Puttenahalli Lake.

Jayashree, Nayantara and Raji were looking more at the birds.

Green Sandpiper

 and Raji was practising with her DSLR and new lens. We watched Pond Herons and Little Egrets chasing each other away from where they felt they could get the goodies. Black Kites, two Brahminy Kites, and a lone Red-rumped Swallow, swooped along. Purple Moorhens, oops, sorry, Swamphens,

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/12696846853/" title="DSC09189 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7338/12696846853_e934334a4f_z.jpg" width="640" height="439" alt="DSC09189"></a>

 quarrelled and bickered, as is their wont. Common Coots and Little Grebes bobbed up and into the water, and Spot-billed Ducks and a few Garganeys made us stand and stare, the manner approved by the poet. 

I watched several kinds of spiders, too, and would like some help with the id of some of them....are these baby Theridids in this photo? It was stunning to watch them scramble around when even a slight breeze disturbed them!
