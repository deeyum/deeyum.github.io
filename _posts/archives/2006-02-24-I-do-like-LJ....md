You may have noticed that many of my posts are "quotes" from other LJ's...I love visiting other people's LJ's...there is always something interesting, intriguing, fascinating, something I learn, some new ideas that I can mull upon...

LJ takes me into people's minds and hearts and bypasses all the external stuff (dress, appearance, cultural and age differences, etc.) I thoroughly enjoy my visits.

Long live blogging!
