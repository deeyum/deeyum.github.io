Apart from the other birds sighted at Lalbagh last Saturday, it was lovely to see four BRAHMINY KITES enjoying the air currents and gliding lazily around, landing on the huge Ficus benjamina trees and then taking off again. Here are some shots I took of these handsome birds in flight:

Here's one of them  in front view:

And one that catches the bird as it soars up:

And another that catches it using those powerful wings to great effect:

Alas, I never got all four birds close enough together to get a single shot of them...but obviously, the Brahminy kites at Lalbagh are breeding and doing well, and that is heart-warming..as usually, one gets to see only one Brahminy kite for every twenty or thirty Black (pariah) kites.


I still think we human beings have been incredibly foolish in our evolutionary path, not to have learnt how to fly (by ourselves, that is)!
