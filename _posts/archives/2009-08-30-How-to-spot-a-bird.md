First, you look at the scenery.

Then you see the bird.

Can you see the bird in the first picture? I assure you, it's there....

You have to look close:

Then, of course ( well, this time I was a Solitaire too, but on  usual birding trips, by this time your fellow-birders have moved on FAR ahead) you look closERRRRR:

You take a quick foozly shot and run to catch up with whoever you are with, whether it's family or fellow-birders, wondering which part of the innocuous-looking landscape is hiding more birds now!

PS. the bird in this lot of foozles is a TOWNSEND'S SOLITAIRE....funny name for a bird that I saw two of! :)
