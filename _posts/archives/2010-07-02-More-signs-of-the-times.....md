I was intrigued by this "head meat"

until I realized that it is probably "bheja" or brain....and that "kalu soup" is made from trotters....so you can truly eat, head to foot!


<lj-cut text="a few more">


If, after eating all that, you develop a rash and can't drive...

you have to go for some tharphy....

but then, of course, you will get a headache trying to put your kid in this school:

How rare to find honesty in this world...this auto describes itself as "dangerous".....

And, living in an apartment building where milk sachets are delivered every morning and are often stolen (sometimes by monkeys)...I loved the idea of a Milk Box that I saw on a gate as we walked:

In all the rush of traffic, this one intrigued me a lot....

WHOM does s/he call dad? The policeman? God? The fellow-passenger?

It's definitely worth having MLC around all the time!
