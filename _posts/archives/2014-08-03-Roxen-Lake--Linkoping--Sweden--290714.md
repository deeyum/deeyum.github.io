<a href="http://www.visitlinkoping.se/en/do/inspiration-discover-linkoping-and-its-surroundings/waters-linkoping/around-lake-roxen"> Lake Roxen </a>

is one of the beautiful attractions in the Swedish town of Linkoping, and since I'd borrowed a small folding bike, <lj user="prashanthchengi"> and I decided to cycle down (we'd walked to the lake previously.)

The weather was very unusually warm even for Swedish summer, but I manfully (womanfully?) pedalled my two tiny wheels, and we started with this beautiful rainbow (though I couldn't see any rain clouds!)

We cycled through brown grass and green:

We came to the place where the road to the lake branched off from the highway:

A fleecy dolphin floated overhead:

<lj-cut text="more about the outing">

We explored a place where there was massive earth-moving and construction going on; Barn Swallows were swooping around, taking mud for their nests.

Here's my cycle, and the earthmover!

Wildflowers bloomed everywhere:

this is wild dill:

Taking a rough path instead of the road, we found it very enjoyable:

A 

COMMON TORTOISESHELL

sat with its wings closed:

So did another butterfly:

There were several 

EUROPEAN GREENFINCHES around,

feeding on the berries:

A

COMMON KESTREL

delighted me, high overhead:

Roly-poly, curly-woolly sheep grazed on the farmland:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14797716044" title="IMG_5811 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5569/14797716044_fb2fd3f536_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5811"></a>

Horses rubbed against each other, companionably:

the golden wheat was nearly ready for harvesting:

I could spot the lake:

We rode up to the water:

A beautifully-flowering acquatic plant welcomed us.

As did a sitting 

ARCTIC TERN

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14613424029" title="IMG_5825 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5589/14613424029_5e948a4403_z.jpg" width="640" height="440" alt="IMG_5825"></a>

and several ducks:

The houses on the lake were picture-perfect:

The sun in the trees and the reeds was beautiful.

I was thrilled to spot a

MUTE SWAN

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14613430330" title="IMG_5854 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2907/14613430330_2f6331474b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_5854"></a>

The swan moved in front of the resting GULLS:

It was quite far away, but my zoom came in handy:

then I sawa whole family, with parents and three cygnets:

This Swan family was one of the highlights, indeed, of my visit to Scandinavia.

Then came the sight of this

GREAT CRESTED GREBE

that I have seen before only in the lap of the Himalaya!

We discovered even more when we came back to the area the next day...but that's the next post!
