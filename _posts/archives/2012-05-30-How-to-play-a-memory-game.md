First, the family assembles, having decided on a "staycation" for Memorial Day weekend:

KTB proves pretty good at remembering where similar cards are:

But alas, she's far more interested in the coloured ribbon:

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5708-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/IMG_5708-1.jpg" border="0" alt="3 memory game 270512"></a>

And though she takes her turn,

<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5709.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/IMG_5709.jpg" border="0" alt="4 memory game 270512"></a>

Is still far too rapt...literally wrapped...with the ribbon.

Her mother sort of sweeps the game:

From L to R, pile 1 is KTB, 2 is me, 3 is KTB's mom, and 4 is KTB's dad! Much squabbling ensues between Mom and Dad about the results. 

Before this, of course, the ribbons were used gymnastically:

And a very St.Louis-type arch results:

The simple joys of being at home together!
