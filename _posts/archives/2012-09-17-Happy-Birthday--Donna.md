<lj user="pondhopper">, I've seen you taking the time and trouble to wish each of your friends, unfailingly, on their birthdays....so here's wishing you health, happiness...and most important, peace of mind, in the years ahead!

I hope to be able to meet you and Manolo one day, but whether we do or not, we remain staunch friends. Here's one birthday hug, and gadzillion common-or-garden hugs for every single day!

Just back after four days without ANY sort of connectivity, and beginning to deal with the HUGE backlog...but wait for some wonderful pics of Goa, Goan wildlife, reptiles and amphibians...and about the whole trip!
