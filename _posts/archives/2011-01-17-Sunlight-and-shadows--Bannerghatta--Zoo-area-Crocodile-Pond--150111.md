Had a wonderful time at the Bangalore Bird Race 2011. When one has great birders and one indefatigable driver on one's team....it's easy! 


I will be posting pictures and an account soon, but meanwhile....I enjoy the shafts of morning sunlight through the mist...and here's what I captured at the Crocodile Pond at the Bannerghatta Zoo:

It's a pity that the more pollution and smoke in the air, the better the effects are:

Here are our group, wandering through the sunbeams:

It does look as if the Sun is blessing us, as we celebrate Makara Sankranti (the transition of the Sun from dhanur to makara rAshi (Sagittarius to Capricorn.)
