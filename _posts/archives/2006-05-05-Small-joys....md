Walking around in the Jayanagar 9th Block market, quite literally smelling the roses, smiling at the people whom I buy regularly from...buying crisp apples,  firm oranges (oh my, that sounds like that lovely dirty song from "The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox"), pomegranates (which some fruit shops spell as "pome granite"), juicy pears...looking at the trees in full leaf now...knowing that I am happy, and contented...and HOME!
