I tried focusing on the moon while I was taking bird pictures.

On the 29th of March, the moon looked like this...

And today, I watched the full moon rise in honeyed glory, but could not get to my camera! Hope you enjoy the full moon, all you vampires and werewolves (if you werewolves, what are you now?) out there....
