If 

<a href="http://www.wildwanderer.com"> Karthik </a>

comes, can moths be far behind?

Yesterday, he told us that this beautiful 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnis_nerii"> OLEANDER HAWK MOTH </a>

was sitting on the staircase of my apartment, so <LJ user="mohanvee"> and I went off to photograph it...

Meanwhile, he had also spotted these two...a lovely gold-and red one:

and an even prettier "pied" moth....

I guess all moths and butterflies know an expert when they see one, and consider Karthik a kind of foster moth-er....

Couldn't resist that!
