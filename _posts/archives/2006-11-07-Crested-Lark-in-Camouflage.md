Just to give non-birders an idea of how tough it can be to spot birds. Normally I do not post large-size pictures, but this time I will.

Can you spot the Crested Lark in the picture?

<P>Awesome camouflage, isn't it!!

If you couldn't spot it...look along the line&nbsp;of the "vee"shaped bit of dry grass at the bottom of the picture, and you will see the bird.....

That's the kind of thing that raptors face they scan the ground from far above, looking for prey....builds a healthy respect for their abilities when you think about it!</P>
