Three months have gone by.
Life goes on as before..
With unexpected and sudden
Dagger-stabs of sorrow.
I keep them hidden.
The wounds bleed into my heart...
Or is it my heart that bleeds?
Why do these seeds
Of sorrow tear me apart?
When will I cross the ocean of woe
And reach serenity's shore?
We didn't speak to each other often...then why
Do quick tears make my eyes sting and smart?
