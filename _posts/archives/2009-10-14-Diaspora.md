I really like looking at sparrows here; I think they are very much like the Indian diaspora in this country. They are not native to the country, but have made their space here, and are thriving. They manage to survive very well, and yet, they keep a low profile for the most part; amongst the local people, but yet apart, keeping themselves to themselves, at a little distance. They are not interested in making waves or making themselves prominent, only in maintaining their lifestyles in reasonable comfort.

Indians...and perhaps other minority communities too...are the sparrows of America. And yes, I see boards in Forest Park (put up by bird lovers, no less!) which say that since sparrows are not a native species, their nests can be destroyed, and they can be shot...so sparrows are no stranger to mindless, illogical hate, either...
