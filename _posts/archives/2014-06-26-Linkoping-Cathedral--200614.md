After looking at the Midsummer's Eve celebration, I realized that the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link%C3%B6ping_Cathedral"> Linkoping Cathedral </a>

was not very far away, and we walked till the beautiful green-blue spires were near:

<lj-cut text="want to see the Cathedral?">

It was breathtaking to watch the main spire looming up into the sky:

The stained glass windows looked majestic from outside:

Through them, I could also see the effect of the stained glass as it would be if I entered the cathedral:

Here are two of the stained glass windows from the outside:

The side view of the Cathedral:

Some of the tall windows have been damaged,but the damage has been left wisely alone for the most part.

In just a few places, some refurbishment has been done:

A detail of the weather vane:

detail of the trellis work:

The awesome main spire:

The Diocese nearby:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14285452830/" title="IMG_1281 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14285452830_8dfb6df4a4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1281"></a>

How ironic that the school (Gymnastik) nearby incorporates the word "nastik", which means "atheist" in Sanskrit!

Each entrance was imposing:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14285435969/" title="IMG_1256 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3916/14285435969_25a765186e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1256"></a>

This was the main entrance:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14470746652/" title="IMG_1265 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3895/14470746652_99674cb4f2_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1265"></a>


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14468696951/" title="IMG_1266 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3862/14468696951_06a818474e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1266"></a>


<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14285621327/" title="IMG_1264 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2917/14285621327_ebaeaecba4_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1264"></a>

The doors are, predictably, solid:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14285485618/" title="IMG_1273 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3908/14285485618_12902c95f9_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1273"></a>

So are the locks (yes, the Cathedral was locked)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14448968996/" title="IMG_1274 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3899/14448968996_b7b557e285_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1274"></a>

The walls are imposing against the sky:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14448969676/" title="IMG_1276 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5556/14448969676_acdfcaca17_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1276"></a>


The Museum was closed, too, when we reached:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14448969366/" title="IMG_1275 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5529/14448969366_07d826d1fe_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1275"></a>



Right next to the Cathedral is the Linkoping Palace:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14492203743/" title="IMG_1258 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3847/14492203743_e70c401701_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1258"></a>

The Linkoping flag has a tiger on it, which was very appropriate to someone from India!

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14448962916/" title="IMG_1259 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5594/14448962916_cca16a4a2b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_1259"></a>

Was this some kind of sundial? I couldn't make out, and there is no mention in the Wiki:

Here's PC, clicking it, too:

The road with the old coach houses:

The Cathedral as it reaches up to touch the summer sky:

It's very frustrating not to be able to get enough (in English) about this beautiful building and its environs...translating everything from the Swedish is a frustrating job!
