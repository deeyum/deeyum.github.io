I am sending some pictures of the beautiful butterflies that I snapped in the St Louis Zoo...god, it is SO difficult to get these things on camera!!

I don't know most of the id's...so I would appreciate some help on them. There were only volunteers in the Insectarium and even the list of id's that they had didn't match up with the pictures I had...


Let me start with those whose id I *do* know:


Here are the ZEBRA LONGWINGS...
