I always love having the window seat, but on the flight from St.Louis to Orlando, I got only an aisle one. Yet, as I saw the sun sinking in oranges and reds, I started aiming the camera....and the gentleman in the window seat (the middle one was vacant, luckily!), a paralegal from Orlando, asked me if I'd like the window. I accepted with alacrity!

As the plane gained height, I looked out to see the iconic Gateway Arch of St.Louis:

We left the mighty Mississipi behind...

The aircraft wing was a steady feature as the dusk deepened:

The light on the wing was a comforting beacon that the flight was going well (there was a lot of turbulence):

Evening shaded into night, and the twinkling lights of many cities showed themselves below me, as we flew onwards:

The colours of a sunset or sunrise, from an aircraft, are (I feel) really incredible sometimes....
