Ravi Srinivasan has been my friend for a while now, but he had no way of knowing that I knew Karaikudi Mani well for a long time, before losing touch; he did not know that he was my late brother's mAnasIka (mentally accepted as ) guru....and yet, he chose a composition by him, performed by the string quarter...and he chose my photographs for the visual part! 

I am deeply honoured...and yes, Ravi, the rAgam IS behAg....
