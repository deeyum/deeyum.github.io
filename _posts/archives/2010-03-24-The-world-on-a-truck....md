We went for a short walk and found this truck, with so many things on its hood and its roof:

It reminded me of our

The owner of the truck has an everyday festival as he drives around!

Animals, birds, men and women, stones and toys...all together on that engine cover...D assured me that they were well and truly stuck on! What a lovely, unusual vehicle to have! 

Do the toys come alive at night, I wonder...what happens if they find themselves so differently sized? If a giant Tinker Bell towers over a tiny African elephant, will she still feel scared?

If I had a truck like this, it would be a daily inspiration for me to weave stories for KTB...
