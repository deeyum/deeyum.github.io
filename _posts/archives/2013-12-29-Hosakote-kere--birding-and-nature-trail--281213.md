My email to the bngbirds egroup:

In so many years of birding, I had never been to Hosakote to watch birds, so I was very happy when Amith, Gowri Shankar, Kiran  Baagade (who has recently shifted here from Mysore), Ramachandra Gopalakrishna,  and I headed out to the kere (lake).

Sunrise at the kere:

While there, we were joined briefly by Bhanu Prakash, Sanjeev Managoli (on his way to work at Hosakote, he was doing a short birding stint!), and then Rajani Chand, who spent the rest of the morning with us, and guided us to the Raghavendra Talkies part of the kere.

Rajani and Sanjeev:

Little did we know just how rewarding the birding was going to be....but we opened the innings with a mixed bag of water birds and scrub birds.

A Pied Cuckoo,  several Garganeys, a lone Northern Shoveller started off our migrant sightings. We were spoilt for choice as sometimes we didn't know whether to look towards the kere on our right, or the shore on our left!

Watching water birds fishing is always a riveting experience, and we also watched the raptors instilling fear into the birds on the water.

Marsh Harrier flying over the ducks:

 There were more Great Cormorants than Little Cormorants, and we sighted one Indian Cormorant, too, which the experienced birders pointed out to me.

Two Black-winged Kites landed close enough on a tree that we could look up into their ruby eyes....a Booted Eagle and an Indian Spotted Eagle filled up the "E" part of our birding alphabet. Well...yesterday the alphabet did not start with Avadavats, but from Babbler to Warbler, the list seemed very well represented!  Thank you to those who are more experienced,for id'ing the different kinds of Sandpipers for me.

I have to strike one sad note. At one place, plastic netting was hung into the water (which was in channels and ponds there) , presumably, to keep birds from taking the fish. We saw two Pond Herons, dead, strangled in the netting. It was quite a dreadful sight. I would have minded less if the birds had been caught for eating...then they would have been part of the food chain...but to see the dead birds just lying in the netting that had been so callously set out, was heart-rending.

Dead bird in netting:

We broke for brunch only when the call of the Empty Tummy-birds could not be denied

...and we went back to the kere for round two! I am afraid I didn't see too many butterflies, though Kiran pointed some out to me. We dispersed, feeling thoroughly satisfied with our morning of birding.

I think I still need correction on my Sandpiper ids, I'd be grateful for it! I am still rather Sandpiper-illiterate.
