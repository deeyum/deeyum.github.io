Came home to broken pipes in the kitchen (no water, but no flood, either, thankfully!), no maid, a house that's been solidly neglected for about a year...and the baby unerringly finds the dirt!

So I'm taking a break from cooking and cleaning to post some recent advances...

Soon, KTB will cease to be a crawliflower, and become a biped....
