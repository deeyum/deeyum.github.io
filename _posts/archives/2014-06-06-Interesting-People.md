I find almost everyone I meet interesting! Whether it is a random encounter or it turns out to be a long-term friendship..from one end of the spectrum to the other, I rarely meet people whom I actively dislike (though it happens, of course.)

I travelled back from Delhi to Bangalore by train recently. My co-passenger was a lady who described how and why she took a doctorate in Hindi literature...and how she decided that she would marry a medical doctor (she did so). 

 The coach attendant was a young man who described how financial pressure made him take on a job as a catering hey-you on the Indian Railways; twelve years later, his job is still "temporary", but his description of it, and the people HE meets, was fascinating! 

On a training program recently, I met someone disabled by polio, who found a career where, he said, his disability would not matter...he is a deep-sea diver. He told me about submarine life-forms off the coasts of South America.

So...the contact  may be the brief,  odd dash of pepper, or the sustained, staple rice-and-buttermilk...I find almost all people interesting, sometimes, even the ones I dislike, as I try to analyse why I find them nasty. :D
