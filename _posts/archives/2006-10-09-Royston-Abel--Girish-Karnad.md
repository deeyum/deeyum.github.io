....

Two good names in the area of theatre...I went to see "Flowers" yesterday at Ranga Shankara. Impressive, with Rajit Kapoor doing a great job of remembering, word-perfect, a monologue of more than 70 minutes....But I do have some reservations about having too-simple props and no relief at all.....it would have been better if the intensity had had some relief.

Also, I took the front row very happily, only to have the actor tower over me in the set and I had to crane my neck for all that time....nitpicking, I know, but the nit is there to be picked.

What do you think, <lj user="usha123">? You were there too..and <lj user="deepsan">...were you there?

Will be going to see the Bengali plays, probably....
