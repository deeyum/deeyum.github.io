As I felt better in spite of a disturbed night, I decided to walk to, and in, Nageshwara Rao Park.

The park has been really beautified,and is a nice green place to walk, and is large enough that one can walk in a direction opposite to other walkers and not be "herded" along in one direction. 

At several places there are posters of old photographs, depicting the Madras (it wasn't Chennai then) of yesteryears, and there are some majestic old trees that cool one's eyes and soul, too.


There was a yoga class in progress in the sandpit, and several people were walking briskly backwards (I don't know if this will really help their health or just cause surprise, amusement, or amazement in the minds of regular walkers.) Several pretty girls had the fine sheen of sweat on their smooth skins, which looked more appealing than the same sheen on the necks of some young men, alas! Monkey-capped old mamas (hey, hey, I must watch this tendency, they are probably my age!) and head-covered-by-scarves old ladies toddled along, each content to keep up hes own pace. 

It made a very happy beginning to the last day of 2008. 

I have been waiting for KM to finish up some work and then leave for home...but it looks as if it's not going to happen today. So I guess it's going to be a year-long stay at Chennai this time :) Came in 2008 and left in 2009!

2009 was also the registration number of the beloved Premier Padmini (Fiat) that my brother had...sitting and thinking about it.

Waiting, all packed and ready, means that I have been able to do nothing else. But I don't mind being idle in comfort....!

I have internet access now as my sis in law has taken a break from working at home....so I will edit (if this connection permits it) one of my photos and put up a nice New Year message to all of you....if not, I wish each and every one who reads this a happy, healthy, peaceful new year.


But I hope to get my greeting card up...
