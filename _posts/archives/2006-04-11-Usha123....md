Had liked the sound of <LJ user="usha123"> from her responses to my, and <LJ user="shortindiangirl">'s, blogs...we realized we don't live very far apart, and today I called her for a chat...Found an amazingly interesting person who walked out of the groove and is doing something alled to, yet very different from, her earlier profession of paediatrics. I do hope she found me interesting enough to come over and visit, too....!

For what she does now, visit

www.hisp.org

...I am about to do so now!

this takes you to hisp south africa..will post the local link after talking to Usha in a while.
