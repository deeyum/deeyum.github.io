I wrote several articles and "middles" regularly for the Deccan Herald before I started writing for Citizen Matters, and after having met <a href="http://felis.in/about.php"> Sangeetha Kadur </a> and hijacked her and Madhukar (another expert birder whose work with the digiscope can be found <a href="http://gpitta.blogspot.com/2007/12/what-is-digiscoping.html"> here </a> ) home,I
went and googled for the article about the artists who painted the beautiful murals at Bandipur...it's at

Oh, I have referred to it in 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/tag/murals"> this post </a>

Alas, that last mural remains unfinished, and JLR never continued with this great initiative....but Sangeetha continues with her wildlife painting, and is at present working on a book on humming birds! More power to her brush...


Hmm...I thought I had lost all the articles that I wrote, I realize I can hunt for them...these simple things take the Concrete Cauliflower a while to understand!

The Wildscreen Festival proved far more interesting than I budgeted for; the masterclass by Jeremy Bristow was riveting, and the one by Laura Marshall on managing productions, applies to so many situations that demand good scheduling to ensure a successful outcome. More in my writeup for Citizen Matters! :)
