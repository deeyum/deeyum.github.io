YOU THINK MUKESH AMBANI DOESN'T HAVE PROBLEMS. ....

Mukesh bhai gets up from his bed room on 15th floor, 
takes a swim in the swimming pool on 17th floor,
has breakfast on the 19th floor, 
dresses up for office on 14th floor, 
collects his files and office bag from his personal office on 21st floor, 
wishes bye to wife Nita on 16th floor, 
says ‘see you’ to his children on 13th floor &  19th floor,
and goes down on 3rd floor to self drive his 2.5 Crore BMW to office, but then he finds out that he has forgotten the car keys upstairs.
But on which floor? ... 15th,17th,19th,14th,
21st,16th or 13th? 

He phones all his servants, cooks, maids, secretaries, pool attendants, gymtrainers, lift attendants etc. on all the floors.

There is a hectic search and lot of running around on all the floors, but the key is not traceable. 

Fed up, after half an hour of frantic search, Mukesh bhai leaves in a huff in a chauffeur driven Ikon car.

At 3.30 pm late in the afternoon,  it is discovered that 4 days back, a temporary replacement maid had washed Mukesh bhai's pant and hung it to dry on a string in the balcony of 16th floor, with car keys in the pant pocket.
The key was blown away somewhere by the high winds at 16th floorlevel and was never found.
This was detected because of Nita’s habit of checking clothes given for ironing personally. 

Meanwhile, after 3 days of the incident, Nita Ambani with all irritation writ large on her face, complained to Mukesh bhai asking him where he was roaming till 3 am last night.

Mukesh replied that he was at home all night. “Then why did the helicopter land in the terrace at 3 am? I was so worried. I could not sleep whole night," quizzed Nita. 

"Oh that helicopter”.. That helicopter came from Germany, sent by guys from BMW to deliver the duplicate car key... "mumbled Mukesh.

Moral of The Story : 
A two bed room flat is better. So guys, be happy in your tiny flat....
it saves lots of hassles!
