"Jugaad" means, "innovation", often thinking out-of-the-box. A mode of public transportation, with the engine of a tractor, has already taken on this name in several states of India. 

On Sunday, as we were heading out for our nature trail on Bannerghatta Road, I spotted this tricycle-cart that had been fitted with a two-wheeler engine, and was puttering along happily!

I don't think this gives very environment-friendly emissions, however creative and innovative it is!

What a pity that pedal-power is seen by the working people as something too difficult to sustain.  I was actually thinking of an initiative to re-introduce cycle-rickshaws....
