I just saw something on Facebook (I suppose a friend sent the wrong link) which showed a photo of three girls smoking, and a series of comments about them being "bad girls".

Why, in the twenty-first century, are we still such prudes and hypocrites? And why double standards? Well, at least one person said, " Only if you don't smoke and drink you can say 'bad girls'...".. but there were several other comments, which included the word "bitch".

The questions I am asking are:

So...men can drink and smoke and be "good" people?

Does not smoking and not drinking automatically make a person "good", the way drinking and smoking seem to automatically make a person "bad"? I don't smoke or drink, and I know how bad I can be.

I simply cannot understand how a society that was so open, became such a society of prudery, and utter hypocrisy...being so judgemental about things that do not matter at all.

I am reminded of another FB update...a cleric has said that women should not handle cucumbers or bananas because they should "avoid sexual thoughts". That cleric seems to be to be the most dirty-minded person! He is like the Roscharch-test patient who was shown a series of blots, and asked what they reminded him of. For every blot, his answer was, "Sex". Finally, the psychiatrist told him, "You seem to be obsessed with sex." "Me!" exclaimed the patient. "It's you who've been showing me all the dirty pictures!"

Speaking of which, I saw the movie, "Dirty Picture", and liked it very much. Excellent acting by Vidya Balan, and very well directed, too...and the photography is superb. It shows our double standards...and the way women are utterly exploited. They have to use their bodies as their strengths, and soon the strengths become their weaknesses....


Smoking is bad for the health, that's been proven, but why attach a morally bad tag to it? And many cultures advocate moderate social drinking....
