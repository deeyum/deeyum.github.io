a comment by <lj user="mmk"> made me think...do women really attach more importance to dates (anniversaries, bdays) than men do? I come from a family where dates are not given much importance...so I can see both sides of the "remembering dates" things. I like wishing people for their birthdays and anniversaries if I can....and though it doesn't make much of a difference if no one remembers, it does feel nice to be wished!

and <lj user="sankalpa"> Happy 5th anniversary..hope there are many more.
