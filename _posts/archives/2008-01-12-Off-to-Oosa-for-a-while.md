I am off to Oosa for a while, and I hope the problem that is taking me there is satisfactorily resolved...but you have no hope, oh readers, because the minute I have some spare time over there, I will start blogging again....!

Next post could be from Blr or from Yumrika....I ought to be packing, not typing...but this is a 2min break from the feverish getting-ready-to-go-at-sudden-notice storm.
