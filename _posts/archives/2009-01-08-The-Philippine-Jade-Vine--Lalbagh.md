I went along to Lalbagh this morning, and looked for the flowering Philippine Jade Vine....here's my blog post about it (along with the Asian Paradise Flycatcher, which is another spectacular sight you can see at Lalbagh if you are lucky)....

That is the original colour of the flower...isn't it exquisite!
