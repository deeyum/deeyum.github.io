Having had to postpone our trip to Nandi Hills due to torrential rains on Saturday, we decided to make the trip  on Sunday morning, and Anand, Kannan, Priyanka, Sushil, Vaibhav, and I left at 4.30am on Sunday morning.

I rarely post black-and-white photos, but this view of the ramparts of the Nandi Hills wall, the trees and the clouds...and that monkey sitting there...needs bnw!

Here's one of the things that's special about Nandi Hills:

Here we are, having stopped on the road up, to see what we could sight:

I used the little Fuji camera to capture the beautiful view of the hills rising out of the mist:

I tried to get the spectacular effect of the sun's rays through the clouds:

We walked down the sheet rock:

and enjoyed the view:

The villages below smiled in the slowly emerging sunshine:

But most of the time, we were avidly looking into the trees, spotting and observing birds!

By the afternoon, the tourists had started arriving (I think the prospect of heavy rain kept them away in the morning, which was good for our birdwatching!) Some of them, obviously, had their hearts flying!

I cannot take enough pictures of this old pavilion, shaded by the timeless, majestic trees:

Have posted some of the birds we saw to my Facebook album,
