Why do relationships die?
I'm sure I can't tell you why.
The sweetness, the joy...
They turn sour, by and by.
One person seems to stop
Loving another; a sigh
Of sadness, a teardrop...
A wariness, a fear...
Happiness in each other
Turns to an attempt to smother
The fact that it feels
No longer the wonder
That it was before.
Before things go under...
Perhaps there's time to shore
Up the weak spot, and retrieve
The magic...but life's not fair
Or kind, or just. 
Is there hope in the air..
Or is it just dust?
