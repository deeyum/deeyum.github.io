Received the notification of Blank Noise's activities too late to join their blogathon...but this is a subject close (quite literally!) to my heart....so here's the link...

whenever it's time for the next blogathon, I will blog about it too. I was abused, my daughter was abused....and I remember one time at the Pooram Festival, when we were walking back to our car after witnessing the spectacle...the crowd was full of Mallu octopuses (less brains, more arms) grabbing at both of us...is there a woman alive who has not gone through this torture?

If I can, I will be part of the "intervention" too....
