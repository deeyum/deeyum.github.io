I have written, I think, about Shyamal....in a world full of serious ornithologicalstudy, he leavens his knowledge with a lot of humour. (He is still capable of a scholarly treatise with words I can hardly understand!)

Here's a bird-list which he apparently sent the birdwatching egroup on April 1, 2000:

A chucklist of birds typically seen in April

In the woods of the Western Ghats one gets to see the
Rocket-tailed Drongo,
Laughing Thrust,
Bleak-backed woodpokers,
If you are really lucky you may get to see
Paradise Female-catcher

In the wetlands one may get to see some of the late staying
Green Sandpapers
Wood Sandpapers
Little Stunts
Kentish Pullovers
Bare-headed Geese
Pint-aled Ducks and
Black-pied tailwags

You may also get to see some of the resident
Whistling Tools and
Paid Kingfishers

In the large rivers one gets to see the
Sneak Birds fishing by sneaking up to fishes
and the Brown-headed gals with the mirrors flying along with whiskered
turns.
Sometimes one gets to see the Block-headed gals without the mirrors.

Some of the bards in danger are the Spot-billed Bellycans
Painted Strokes and Glassy-eyed Ibis.

On the open lands one sees the
Who-Poohs,
Small-grin beaters,
White-bellied Manias,
and Yellow-bottled Lapwings.

My thanks to many beard-watchers for their observations used in preparing
this chicklist
notably Emby Crush, S.Supermania, Jay N. Pressured ,U.K.Hurricane, M.S.Giant
and J.H.He-man.


I just *love* this list. Each time I read, a different name sets me laughing uncontrollably!

Shyamal...thank you!

Update: there was a report from Bngbirds about a Wholly Naked Stork, and a friend of mine remarked about the Blue Moron butterfly...Also on INW, I have seen photos of a herd of clouds, a Wild Bore, and so the list goes...
