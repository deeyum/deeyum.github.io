Can you imagine being charged for SALT? How ridiculous can bills get...did he order half a kilo or something? They've charged Rs.98 for a lemon-and-soda, and rubbed the salt into the wound!

I put this up on the Facebook page of the group that owns this restaurant...and I have not got any response, and in fact, my post has been deleted!
