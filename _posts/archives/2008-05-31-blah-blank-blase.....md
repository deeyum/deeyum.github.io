Very unusual state of affairs for me. I have no thoughts, I have nothing that I feel like recording, I don't feel like uploading any pictures today....so I am posting THAT as a noteworthy occurrence! :)

Oh, I do have a thought. I am very impressed with a newspaper headline today that says that <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/story/316311.html">  the Government has *agreed* to set up a panel </a> to handle the rehabilition of the victms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster"> Bhopal Gas Disaster </a>. which occurred in 1984.

Oh my, how fast our Government can *agree* to act!
