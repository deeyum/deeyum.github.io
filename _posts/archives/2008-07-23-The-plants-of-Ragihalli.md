The plants and trees, too, at Ragihalli and Shivanahalli, were lovely to look at. I took a lot of pictures, and am still trying for the id's of some of them. 

At the kere (or lake..it was, actually, larger than a pond but smaller than a lake, so I don't really don't know how to classify it!),we saw a lot of water plants.

I am not sure if this is just a leaf of the water hyacinth, or another plant. But the colours were so amazing, I just had to capture it!

Note the little insect on it...

Here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hyacinth"> WATER HYACINTH </a>...quite a villain...this plant, I am afraid, will soon choke out the water body if it is not rooted out...

Looks so deceptively pretty; but I equate CROWS, WATER HYACINTH and LANTANA in the same way...they crowd out every other living being they share their space with.


On a more positive note, on the sunshade of one of the village homes, I found this beautiful

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichosanthes_cucumerina">SNAKE GOURD </a> flower:

These MUSHROOMS were looking very pretty as we walked over the vegetation:

 There were plenty of these un id WILDFLOWERS on the rocks:

I also loved this carpet of MOSS, and stroking the soft velvet  with my hand was better than having my foot slip on its smooth surface!

In many places, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloriosa_(plant)"> Gloriosa superba (the GLORY or the FLAME LILY) </a> was abloom, what striking flowers they are!

There was this small wildflower which grew directly on the back of the leaflets of the plant!

I thought this was some floral development on this leaf, but Karthik told me it is probably a MEALY BUG with its legs showing on either side of the leaf, I wish I had looked more carefully, but I didn't want to disturb anything!

Another plant was covered with these

WOODY FLOWERS, and made a beautiful picture:

Some of the woody plants had these UN ID FRUIT:

I saw this CLERODENDRUM, with  an insect flying near it, for pollination:

After many decades, I saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadamba_tree"> KADAMBA trees </a>  in the Ramakrishna Ashram; apparently they are prized for their attar. Here's the beautiful

KADAMBA FLOWER:


<a href="http://s297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/?action=view&current=IMG_6334-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm205/depontis/IMG_6334-1.jpg" border="0" alt="kadamba flower with bee Anthocephalus cadamba and Nauclea cadamba of the Rubiaceae family"></a>


Oh, btw, googling for that tree also brought up this <a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/kadamba.html"> Kadamba as the basic ancient script from which Kannada has evolved </a>

It also brought up <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=udZWwms7rgwC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=kadamba+flower&source=web&ots=rQ0t0HvlR5&sig=ZQXH2xvyOiIU8_d86kA-tBkAbQ4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result">  this intriguing entry </a>


At the ashram I also saw these

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betel">BETEL VINES </a>  being grown. These are so much a part of our lives:

I remember crushing the special "KumbhakONam" betel leaves and giving them, in a little honey, to my daughter, to cure her cough and cold.

Even with domestic plants, there was something to see and appreciate. I thought these were holes where insects had eaten away the leaves, until I looked at the colouring and realized that they were

Patterns on Crotons:

Sometimes the leaves and stems themselves made a lovely picture:

This post shows why I will never be disappointed or bored when I am on a field trip!
