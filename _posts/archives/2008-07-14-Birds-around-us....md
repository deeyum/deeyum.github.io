Been busy with a wedding of someone who is like family to me. The wedding was held in a resort fairly close to home. There was a lot of greenery around...and I was delighted to spot a pair of SCALY-BREASTED MUNIAS proceeding to make a nest in the foliage.

Here's one of them, that I caught on my MLC (Mary's Lamb Camera):

I didn't take this near the nest, though, for fear of disturbing the two pretty birds.

I also saw what I *think* (and hope) was a sparrow's nest in one of the hedges....Hasiru (Greenery) is indeed Usiru (life) for these birds!
