It was a delightful suprise to this clicker



<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6387.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6387.jpg" border="0" alt="the clicker 100710"></a>



 when DnA asked me if they could take KTB (Kavya-the-Biddles)  birding to Valley School...so off we went this morning! At the age of 1 year and 2 months, she is definitely the youngest birdwatcher I know.

Here's the family, all ready to start birding:

We were, quite literally, up with the lark...at least, this 

JERDON'S BUSHLARK:

<lj-cut text="all about the outing that was as short as the birder was young">


We were soon joined by the Valley School dog (there were 3, actually)

Our sightings started on a high note when we saw this 

ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD

atop a tree:

Then I pointed out the

LAUGHING DOVE



<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7456.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7456.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

and the

ASHY PRINIA 

sitting on the same tin roof!

A

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIA 

was obviously engaged in home construction:

DnA enjoyed seeing the "clown" red cheek patches of the

RED-WHISKERED BULBUL:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6372.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6372.jpg" border="0" alt="red-whiskered bulbul vs 100710"></a>


they all listened to the 

ORIENTAL MAGPIE ROBIN 

singing:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6373.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6373.jpg" border="0" alt="oriental magpie robin 100710"></a>


They didn't know that the

WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER

ate insects as well as fish:

My daughter spotted the 

BLUE-FACED MALKOHA

ahead of everyone:

KM, meanwhile, looked at the

WHITE-BROWED BULBUL:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6393.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6393.jpg" border="0" alt="white-browed bulbul vs 10710"></a>



It was lovely to see this

COPPERSMITH BARBET

visiting its nest, without any fear of us!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7521.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7521.jpg" border="0" alt="100710 coppersmith barbet at nest vs"></a>


These juvenile

GREEN BEE-EATERS 

made a lovely picture against the blue sky:

At the pond area, we watched the resident

TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER

singing so beautifully:


<lj-embed id="362"/>


There was a 

FANTAIL FLYCATCHER

too, but I couldn't get a photograph!

At the far edge of the pond, I saw these

COMMON MOORHENS:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7500-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7500-1.jpg" border="0" alt="100710 common moorhen vs"></a>


It was fun to watch people going single file across the pond bund:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7503-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7503-1.jpg" border="0" alt="line on pond 100710"></a>

Though KTB was generally well-behaved, there were episodes of "Carry me! I won't walk any more!" (Sometimes, on long birding trips, I also feel like doing the same!)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7480.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7480.jpg" border="0" alt="won&#39;t walk! 100710"></a>

DnA enjoyed clicking each other as much as their surroundings:

I caught some of the butterflies around, alas, not all of them!

Here's a 

WHITE-YELLOW TIP:

This dragonfly's a 

SCARLET MARSH HAWK:

and a 

TAWNY COSTER:

I pointed out the copper pods that give the

COPPER-POD SHIELD-BEARER TREE

its name:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7472.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7472.jpg" border="0" alt="copper-shield bearer 100710"></a>

KTB, of course, also enjoyed the antics of this puppy....

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7496.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7496.jpg" border="0" alt="puppy vs 100710"></a>


and, even more, the antics of this baby

MACAQUE:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7508.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_7508.jpg" border="0" alt="baby macaque 100710"></a>

</lj-cut>

So, though the need for KTB's breakfast, and the increasing heat, cut our birding trip short, it was a most enjoyable one, and here are DnAnK, posing for us....

Three cheers for the youngest birder I know!

Not bad for less than 2 hours!

KTB id'd EVERY bird correctly... whenever she saw a bird, she said "bubbuh", which means bird, and you can't get more correct than that!
