I wanted to use the backlight on that lovely creeper and its flower; they are trained to grow around the cottages.


and this one below is the Pongaemia tree (HongE in Kannada), which is a common avenue tree in Bangalore, also; biodiesel is supposed to be extracted from this tree.

It is just about at the end of its flowering cycle now; a few weeks ago, the roads were carpeted with these flowers!
