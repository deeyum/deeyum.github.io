....


We spotted three Pied Kingfishers, all hovering and then swooping into the lake surface for fish, at our friends' farmhouse; here's a zoom shot of one of them. It isn't too crisp, but given the distance, I am pretty satisfied....after all, if you want to really see superb bird photos, just go to the LJ's of <lj user="yathin">, <lj user="kalyan">, <lj user="kaadupapa">,<LJ user="sainath">,or so many of my friends!

But I love this fellow's perky, alert look...he is looking down into the lake, waiting for the next meal to show itself!
