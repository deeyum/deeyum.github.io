Obviously, I haven't got too many images of GD to share, since I came back...but I just got a lovely one of her, with her  special-sized trolley, at the store (I'd say this was Trader Joe's)....

I suspect that soon DnA will teach her to cycle, and then she will be doing all the family shopping while she is at the daycare....
