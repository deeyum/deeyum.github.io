zzzz
are the lyrics.

Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?
 Donde esta Santa Claus? 
And the toys that he will leave?
 Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus?
 I look for him because it's  Christmas Eve.

I know that I should be sleeping, 
But maybe he's not far away, 
Out of the window I'm peeping, 
Hoping to see him in his sleigh.

I hope he won't forget 
to clack his castinet,
 And to his reindeer, say, 
"Oh Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,"
 Ole! Ole! Ole! 
cha cha cha.

Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?
 Oh! Where is Santa Claus?
It's Christmas Eve.
Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus? 
 I look for him because it's Christmas Eve.
I know that I should be sleeping, 
But maybe he's not far away, 
Out of the window I'm peeping, 
Hoping to see him in sleigh.

I hope he won't forget 
to crack his castinet, 
And to his reindeer, say, 
"Oh Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen," 
Ole! Ole! Ole!
 cha cha cha.
Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus? 
Oh! Where is Santa Claus? It's Christmas Eve.
It's Christmas Eve. It's Christmas Eve. It's Christmas Eve. 
Alright, Mamacita. I'll go to sleep now. It's Christmas Eve......


Merry Christmas, and happy holidays, everyone!
