My baby ran her 3rd half-marathon....and her timing was 2 hr 3 min 58 sec. This is her personal best....

I'm proud of her for running it, never mind the time! She might have bettered her time, but she took the time and the effort to help others to run; the person who ran with her hadn't run at all, two months ago. And he turned in 2 hrs 8 min (approx.)!

THAT's what I am most proud of....
