Temperatures in the high 90's, and GD-sitting duties, mean I am housebound most of the day...but I can still prowl around the house with the S10! All these images have been taken  from within five feet of the house...

Early mornings, the lawn sprinklers come on across the length and breadth of suburban USA...

It's the time of year when the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_palmatum"> JAPANESE MAPLE </a>

planted in thousands of gardens, start making their seeds, which will "helicopter" their way into the world :

The Japanese maples seem to come with the

 (probably drove over in their Toyotas!), which are busily munching away:

Other seeds, in the grasses, also get ready to be blown off on the wind:

Other life-forms perpetuate themselves differently...here's the pupa of the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_bagworm"> BAGWORM </a>

made up of the small bits of the leaves of the plant itself...

As I wandered around, at the very back on one hedge-bush, I found this beatifully constructed spider web. Now, that perfectly formed circle (the funnel in this one hasn't yet been fully formed), and 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/557441.html"> others like that I had seen </a>

 told me that this is the

but as I watched, the spider ran off inside and did not come out again as long as I was there...then I had to go out....let's see what it's caught tomorrow!

This is a Life Under Foot post...life forms which are just underfoot, and literally under a foot or an inch, can be really fascinating!
