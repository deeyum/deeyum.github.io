One of the common dragonflies around this area is called the Granite Ghost.

When I saw it first, it was flying around, and Uma told me the name. Within a few minutes, it landed on the granite rocks, and I understood its name...

How's that for camouflage? That's how these insects can, I suppose, sit out in the open and not become prey to passing predators....

Here's a close-up, showing where it is:

The way the dragonfly just seems to melt into the rock is fascinating...!
