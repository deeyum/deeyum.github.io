Hip and ankle pain had been getting in the way of my exercise...as had the increasingly warm weather. I started swimmiing a few days ago...and am glad to realize that it is not really lethargy that has set in. I enjoy swimming so much, especially at twilight...yesterday the pool lights had also not been switched on, and I could see the half moon slowly rising over the top floor as I swam up and down our small pool...when exercise is this pleasant, keeping fit is no big deal.
