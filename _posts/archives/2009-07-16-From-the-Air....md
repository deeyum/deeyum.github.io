I really love taking photographs while the aircraft is in the air; one can get some remarkable effects with light, the clouds, and the sun and moon. Here are a few that I got while going to LA and returning to St Louis. However, I realize that the aircraft window adds a blue filter to the photographs, and I don't know how to compensate for it. <LJ user="amoghavarsha">, <LJ user="yathin">...any suggestions?

The fact that the window was somewhat fogged didn't help, either! But I never mind posting DMQ photographs (DM Quality)...so here goes..



Here's downtown LA with a passing aircraft, in the shadow of the San Gabriel mountains:

One of the many impressive flyovers as I flew over half the breadth of this great land:

The LA shoreline, with the lovely blue ocean:

A large ship, at anchor:

A litte tug, with its wake:

Alas, that picture has me giggling helplessly as there is nothing it reminds me more of, than a sperm swimming! Well, I haven't actually SEEN one (it's not as if they are doing their laps at the local swimming pool) but the photos of them I've seen are similar...!

The clouds put up their usual fantastic show:

One of the things I love about flying over land, and the reason why I still *always* want a window seat, is that one can see such a lot of landmarks! We passed the edge of the Grand Canyon...here are the first bluffs:

Here's a huge fissure...I wonder if that IS the beginning of the mighty Colorado river?

I got a view of the typical cliff-faces as the aircraft droned onwards:

Soon it was dusk over the cities of the plain:

The wing light was a comforting reminder that everything was going well, so high up in the sky:

But before slipping away, the sun gave me this dazzling effect:
