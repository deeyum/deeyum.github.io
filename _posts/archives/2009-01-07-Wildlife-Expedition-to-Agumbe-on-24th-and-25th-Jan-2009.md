<LJ user="amoghavarsha">  aka Amoghavarsha J S, who has moved from the I T industry to become a wildlife photographer, is well-known to all of us. His photographs have been featured in the WWF calendar, and he has been showcased in prestigious magazines such as Better Photography.  His last wildlife expedition to Agumbe was a great success (yes, I know, because KM and I went!) and by popular demand, he is repeating the expedition this month, on the 24th and 25th January 2009.

The Agumbe Rainforest Research Station is an awesome place, where there's an ongoing  telemetry project  to track the King Cobra.....and there's also Agumbe town itself, a picturesque place with the heritage home, Dodda Mane, where "Malgudi Days" was shot. The sunrise from Agumbe mountains is a photographer's delight. This is a beautiful time of year to be in the Western Ghats.

This is primarily a wildlife expedition, so photography won't be "taught" as such, though Amogh will always be on hand to give you tips!

If you are interested, you could look at my field trip reports:

Of course, you would see different things, or the same things, differently! Each of us who attended the last expedition had very different images and memories of the trip..

Do book your seats early; last time there were a few people who couldn't be accomodated at the last minute.
