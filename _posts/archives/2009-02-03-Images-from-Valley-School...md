I think that I shall never get
A good pic of the Blue-Faced Malkohet.
(Actually, the name of the bird
Is not Malkohet...that's absurd.)
But the stupid Malkoha
Sees my lens... and does Yoga.
It twists and turns and always goes
Into some weird writhing pose.
So I will stop photography
Of that stupid Malkohy....

But the colours of Spring...here are the amazing colours on the fresh new shoots on the Banyan tree (yes, that large one right at the end of the open path!)

The stark red of the Scarlet Morning Glory is beautiful, too...

Here's something that someone who is actually 22 years old sent me:

Funny how markings on a sheet of paper can move you to tears!
