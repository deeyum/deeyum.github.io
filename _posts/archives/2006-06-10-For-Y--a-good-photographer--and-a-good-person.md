He started out proficient
In the world of Eye tee
And turned out he was really good,
As well, at photographee.

His photo was selected
By a Lab of Ornithologee
They liked, they said, his photograph
Of the wild turkee.

I haven't ever met him yet
Nor has he met mee
But I am most impressed with him
..May, forever, his lens roam free.
