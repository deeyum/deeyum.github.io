I do hope you have a Facebook account, and enjoy my account of the visit...must be wonderful to be educated in such a beautiful place!

Off to Florida in while, where there will be a huge family gathering (about 30 family members, apart from friends!) for our niece's arangEtram...I don't know how much internet access I will have, or how much time I will have for it, either!
