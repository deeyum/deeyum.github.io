Age is one thing, maturity quite another. 

When will I get the maturity to accept the things that have bothered me....friendships that are over, lack of understanding from even close ones sometimes, the fact that dead people will never be around again...what should be simple to accept is NOT.

I keep trying to grow as a person, but with such limited success. Calmness vanishes, emotions rule, I lose my peace of mind.

Truly, the most difficult conquests are those within ourselves.
