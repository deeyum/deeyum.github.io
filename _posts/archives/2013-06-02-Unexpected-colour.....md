Milk...is white...and the job of feeding it to a baby every day (and the other care associated with it) can be bland and boring.

But when you least expect it, like a baby's toothless smile, or the sight of two fat legs kicking when I am changing the nappies....colour hits me.

I was washing up, and the film of soap looked so wonderful....I ran for the camera (which is generally on the counter top!) and as I'd hoped, the film had not yet broken..

A moment of delight! Happiness is made of tiny moment such as these...
