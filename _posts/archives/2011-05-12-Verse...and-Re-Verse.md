Someone whom I've yet to meet face-to-face, but who has impressed me with his many-faceted skills, wrote this and emailed it to me!

My (Rubber)neck Exercises While at the 'Puter

Wide open is my office door
As working at my desk I sit
Performing some routine chore
The keyboard keys I merrily hit

Out in one of the cubicles
Jenn takes an incoming call
While idly filing her cuticles
And sipping from a latte tall

Over the monitor I peek
Stretching my neck doing so
As she continues to speak
I admire her top cut quite low

I guess it's her boyfriend calling
Most likely about a date
I lean so much I risk falling
I hear, "Awesome!" then "Great!"

To better catch their love talk
My head from side to side I tilt
Don't let this cause alarm or shock
My neck muscles are well built!

At call's end she sits up straight
Her lissome physique nice 'n taut
I rue my excess body weight
Sighing, "That Jenn sure's hot!"

Middle age does make me sad
As the Jenns of the world float by
At least for one thing I am truly glad
To neck pain I can say, ... "Good bye!"

And that inspired me to respond:


Look at the office Lothario
In the middle of his ogling scenario.
Popping eyes and open mouth
And a hefty chest that has slipped south.
"He may look at girls," said a colleague sage;
"But the only thing that goes up..is his age!"
