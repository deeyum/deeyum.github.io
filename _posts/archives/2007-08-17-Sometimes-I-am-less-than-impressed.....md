Review of Shakuntala Remembered at Ranga Shankara (today) for Metroblogs:

http://bangalore.metblogs.com/archives/2007/08/shakuntala_remembered_at_ranga.phtml


All of us (we went in a group of 4) were also annoyed at the rates of admission being 150 rupees, surely, quite expensive for a play which seems to have so much financial support...


What a contrast with the play, "To the Death of my own family" which I watched two Saturdays ago....Farah Bala gripped us from the word go, with a superb play by David Meth! She played several characters of an Afghan family which goes back to Afghanistan from the US, is decimated, and of which only one daughter comes back alive to the US, where she has been born and brought up, only to be treated with suspicion by the Immigration Department...the direction of the play by Peter Ratray was superb, too...what started as a 10 minute play evolved into an hour's presentation, and had us coming home with Farah's wonderful acting and deep sincerity to her craft etched in our minds. 

You can find out more about "To The Death Of My Own Family" at

(that's the URL the simply designed, but excellent, brochure, gives.)

After the play there was a 15 minute interactive session which was also very good.

Well...fair play or foul, I go to everything I can at Ranga Shankara...!
