The insect, too, must have come out after the showers....

Update: sorry for the boo-boo, now you can see it properly...I will be going to the parlour again tomorrow (this is on a friend's Reliance card!) so perhaps more entries tomorrow....hope not too many of you have posted interesting thoughts and pics!
