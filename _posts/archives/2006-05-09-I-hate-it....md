I do HATE dental work, but the R V Dental College seems a good place to get it done, if it has to be done. Of course one has to wait, but that's part of the deal...the place is clean, you don't have to worry about where they learnt their dentistry (in Chennai, I went to the allegedly very best dentist and she botched my root canal up and it was re-done TWICE after that)...and the dentists are pretty competent, too.

But the indignity of sitting in a reclining chair for more than an hour at a time, with your mouth wide open (with a bright green rubber cloth in it, and various instruments sticking out..I didn't know how I looked but when I looked across at someone else I nearly swallowed my own rubber cloth in helpless laughter), your jaw aching while unnamed horrors are being perpetrated on you by this being who now has you at his mercy....and who asks you if you have any problems and the first problem is that you want to shut your mouth, not talk about problems!

Why can't we have all our teeth out and have a nice row of beautiful looking caps? That would save a lot of time and trouble.

You never know where these local dentists, with their dingy clinics, have got (or bought) their degrees....most of them reach deep into your mouth and extract the contents of your purse.

I am recovering slowly...I will have to go back for the rest of the sittings, and I am NOT looking forward to that!
