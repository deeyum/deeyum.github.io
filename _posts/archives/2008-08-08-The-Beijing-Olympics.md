First of all, see date and time stamp. :D. I don't know how to manipulate that, so I got it on the nail!



I got these pictures off the TV, on DD Sports....

The Opening Ceremony of the Beijing Olympus (oh my goodness, you know you are a camera freak when you call the event the Olympus instead of the Olympics!!)  started at 080808,080808, Chinese time..it was 1738 hours for us.

They started with immense fanfare, and I decided to get my camera; by then, they were showing how China had given the world paper:

Chinese gymnastics were shown, too:

Several symbolic items were shown:

Chinese music and musical instruments were displayed:

This was one of hundreds of dancers at the Bird's Nest Stadium, Beijing:

This very young pianist held the audience spellbound:

There was a globe on which the map of the world appeared, and I clicked when India showed:

Every now and then, there were amazing fireworks, which were also invented in China:

Several dancers formed the "bird" in the Bird's Nest:

Lots more fireworks lit up the skyline of Beijing:

The stadium looked incredibly beautiful in the light of the fireworks:

And then, of course, we had to remember that we were in India:

But the problem was speedily rectified (otherwise the cable operator might not be alive now)...and after several other countries, came....

In spite of my every wish to be a world citizen, a tear left my eye and  stole down my cheek as I watched the images....

The opening ceremonies were magnificient...and we were awestruck.


Now to make sure that I post this at 080808 pm, on 080808! It's 24 hour time on LJ.... 

Update: I managed  to post at 8 minutes past 8 o'clock on the 8th day of the 8th month of the year two thousand and 8!

Actually, these kind of "landmarks" or "datemarks" are not really important to me, but it was a challenge to get the pictures uploaded, the entry made, and posted *tingggg!* just so!
