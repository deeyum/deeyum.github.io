Where does this pain come from?
She's grown up, her own woman,
Leading a full life: Happy in her world.
She's loving, welcomes me always,
The leaves of her home and heart unfurled.

Then where does detachment flee to?
Where's my philosophy?
Why this terrible, can't-breathe pain?
Why does this umbilical cord,that comes from the heart,
Trouble me again and again?

I have a great life in my own home,
Friends and dear ones waiting for me
Halfway across the earth.
Why,then, these pangs of separation...
Why does pain always come with birth?

And a child's pain is special:
One feels it, I think, sometimes,
As much as the daughter does...twice as much:
When she screams it's I who shed tears
The pain of a mother's love is such.


Never have a child or adopt one..
There's just too much pain in maternal love.
Love pulled me to her side in just a few hours;
Being with her always feels complete...
But bearing separation seems...now..beyond my powers.

I know I will be happy again,
Feel complete and fulfilled..
All of it without my child at my side.
I will be content and peaceful once more
But right now the wound in my heart gapes so wide...

Do not be attached...the song of the Gita
Is a lesson I seem to have read.
But it's not one I have yet learnt:
To keep my distance from attachment's fires,
To be serene,not get repeatedly burnt.
