I challenge Mr Audubon, or Mr Salim Ali, or any of the expert birders I know, to do birding the way I do it...while pushing a baby stroller with an active baby in it!

Late yesterday evening,  I went to Forest Park with KTB in the stroller, and while walking, suddenly saw this

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kestrel"> AMERICAN KESTREL </a>

overhead...

It was hovering in true kestrel-style, but then, along came a jet plane....

...and off went the Kestrel, disturbed by the noise, perhaps.

But having spotted a beautiful raptor (however far above it was) made my day!
