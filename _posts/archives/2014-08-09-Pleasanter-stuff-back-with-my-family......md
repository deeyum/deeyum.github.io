KTB starts school on Monday, 11th August, 2014; she will attend Wilkinsons School, where she will also participate in a program for gifted children (but will be most of the time with ALL children.)

Here is the family, at the pre-school "picnic" which turned into an indoor meet because of a heavy thunderstorm:

Here she is, with her class teacher, Miss Paige Blansett:

and last but not least, Our Imp of the (as yet) Illiterate:

The painters are overrunning their schedule by over a week; the house is topsy-turvy (I can't even unpack!), A is having an emergency at work and was out at work all night..but family cuddles go on:

My darlings, it's worth all the trouble and expense I go through, to see them!
