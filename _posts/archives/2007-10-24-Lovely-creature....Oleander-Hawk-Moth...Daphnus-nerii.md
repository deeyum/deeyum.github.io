I think <lj user="prashanthks"> posted a pic of something similar, am trying to look at his posts....

update. Yes indeed, here is his post:

Id-entical moth, even if un-id moth! (See below for id)

Can someone tell me what moth this is? Otherwise I will call it the military camouflage moth!

More update: 

The process of id-ing goes like this:

Karthik says: Sphinx moth family Sphingidae. So that's that!

So I look at the Sphinx Moth pics and I think this is Eumorpha....the Pandorus Sphinx Moth.

Then Karthik says, no, that's the Daphnus nerii, which I find, is the Oleander Hawk Moth.

Military camouflage moth was simpler!


Even more update on 011107:

The caterpillar that I had photographed on our Bannerghatta outing has, according to Geetanjali, turned into an Oleander Hawk Moth, so here's the picture of the caterpillar as well:

It's a lovely cat, isn't it? Look at all the Morse Code on its sides!

And

is what the pupa looks like.
