<P>Someone who is on the way to becoming a good friend has been generously lending me genres of music that I have not heard; and I have been listening quite assiduously (is that spelt right?), often with the googled lyrics in front of me

My conclusion... with music, either I like it, or am indifferent to it. If I have to "bring" myself to listen to the music again...it's definitely the latter!

Am willing to try lots of stuff...but just once, henceforth!</P>
