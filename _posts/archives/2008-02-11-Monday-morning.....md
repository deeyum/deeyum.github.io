Couldn't post yesterday because the net connection was down (yes, these things happen to D.Murphy)...so that's Sunday's post down below!

It's minus 9 deg outside...I should know, I rushed out to put the trash for collection (Mondays and Thursdays) and came back rushing much faster than I rushed out! How on earth am I going to get back to Blr, where the summer starts much earlier than the rest of the country, and would be very warm now?!

Ah, but how nice it will be not to spend several minutes layering up before every outing! Reminds me of Calvin,who, at the end of the bundling-up process, tell his mom he has to go to the bathroom...
