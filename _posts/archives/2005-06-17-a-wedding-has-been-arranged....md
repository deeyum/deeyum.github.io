A very close friend's daughter has agreed to a particular alliance and everyone is in a tizzy about the engagement....made me realize how many complications this business of an arranged marriage can lead into, and how simple my child made it for us....I certainly would have hated being told to buy stainless steel vessels and cupboards and jewellery for my daughter!
