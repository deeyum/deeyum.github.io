These three glass bottles were a dollar total...and I bought them mainly because of the lovely picture they'd make....

I love colours shining through glass, and I like the philosophical implication of the fact that while one can see through the glass, one's view is yet, literally, differently coloured  each time! Talking to people is like this; through the coloured glass of their eyes and opinions, one sees the same world differently.
