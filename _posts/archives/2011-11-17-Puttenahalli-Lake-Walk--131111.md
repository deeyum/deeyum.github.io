When 

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Puttenahalli-Neighbourhood-Lake-Improvement-Trust/137383512944384"> Usha Rajagopalan </a>

asked me to take several people around the 1km perimeter of Puttenahalli Lake, I was very happy indeed to conduct the nature trail.

We all assembled there at 6am:

The sun also decided to come up and join us:

<lj-cut text="a little more about the walk">

There were about 50 people altogether, including old friends like Shashi and Shalini.


Obviously, I wasn't able to take too many photographs, but with Poornima and Srini along, we sighted quite a few interesting things, such as this

SPOTTED OWLET

on top of a dead palm trunk:

and this

PURPLE HERON

which seems to be a regular resident:

It was enjoyable having children on the walk, asking lots of questions and ticking off what they saw on their checklists, or (as with the Spotted Owlet) adding to them:

At the end of the walk, a nice breakfast of IVC (Iddli, Vada, Coffee) was served to all the participants, and Usha talked to some of them:

The children sat down to draw their impressions of the walk:

They produced some lovely artwork!

To see the rest of the photographs..including the food!...
