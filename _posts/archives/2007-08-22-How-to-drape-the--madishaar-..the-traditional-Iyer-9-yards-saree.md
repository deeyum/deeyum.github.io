Our use of untailored cloth for both men and women, with a very graceful, beautiful, practical (the panchakaccham for men and the 9 yd saree for women don't do Marilyn-Monroe type fly-ups like the 6 yds varieties do, or float about dangerously, getting ignited on kitchen fires or caught in two-wheeler spokes) end result...oh I do love the 9 yds saree and the traditional panchakaccham dhoti.
