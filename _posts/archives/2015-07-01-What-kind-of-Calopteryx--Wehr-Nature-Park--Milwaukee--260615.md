Names...are so tough.

I was trying to identify this Damselfly.

From the FB post of someone from Poland, I realized that it was a

But having done that, I am not sure how to narrow it down further.

I looked around on the net.

Or a

Seems most likely to be the last one...

but I've decided, nowadays, not to bother too much about a name. Mr W S said it a long time ago, "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"...so..it can be a Demoiselle, or a Jewelwing...either way, it's such a beautiful creature!
