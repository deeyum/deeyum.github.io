In the Hindu religion, we have the concept of the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C5%ABta"> pancha bhoothAs (five elements) </a>

 that make up all matter. 

However, in Tamizh, "Bhootham" also means "demon"...so I was tickled to see these "pancha bhootham" at Chitrakala Parishath, when I went to see the Wildlife Photography exhibition yesterday....

Each demon-face is normally put in front of a new building or construction, so that its "ugliness" will attract the "evil eye" away from the building itself...but with these five colours, these faces have become quite beautiful themselves!

DnA took one of these faces home to St.Louis on one visit... :)
