....

I think it was Chirdeep who exclaimed, "Look at that!" as we were coming back from the safari on the 9th morning, and were nearly back at JLR....out came the cameras, quickly!

The eatery opposite, which must&nbsp;have been throwing meat or food&nbsp;out in the open, &nbsp;was obviously the reasons these pariah kites (also called black kites) were lined up like this....but it reminded me of politics...a lot of birds of prey, sitting on the fence and wondering which side would suit them better!

You can see a much better version of many of my photos when my co-wildlifers post their pictures...wait for them!
