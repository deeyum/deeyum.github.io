I like to put things into the drafts folder on both my gmail and Outlook Express...the pickle jar for my ideas and words, I guess...

I found this just now when going through the gmail drafts folder for something else, and here it is, in its glory and halo:


The African or Asian Buffalo
Seems to need,always, in mud, to wallo.
The look on his face
To me, definitely says
That his IQ must be rather shallo.

Which,in turn, prompted this impromptu just now:


Dear
Edward Lear
Never fear
That you were laid on your bier...
I am here
Limerick lovers can now shed a tear!

And while on the buffalo:
