It's one of my favourite places, but yesterday, I went not to the JLR property, but to a home-stay in a village in the interior. It gave me a different perspective of the place...not just the forest I usually see, but the forest in conjunction with the lives of the villagers who live on its fringes.

We were walking, and I saw the most incredibly beautiful scenes...it's awfully late, so I'll just post one here...

Why do I need to post-process when Nature gives me colours like that?

And one of the highlights of the trip:

Ah, love...
