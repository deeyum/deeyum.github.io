Here's what <LJ user="gaur36"> has to say...

It *does* exclude many good photographers for no good reason that I can see.

Why cannot these competitions have an honour system, requiring participants to declare that the image has not been manipulated in any way?

<LJ user="yathin">, <LJ user="amoghavarsha">, <LJ user="shivakumar_l"> and other photographers that I know....what is your opinion on this?
