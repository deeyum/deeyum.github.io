I met Malvika and Casey, who are both biologists, and we realized that we had birdwatching interests in common...so last weekend, with Malvika's mother Neelima, we went to the Shaw Nature Reserve.

The beauty of the trail winding along towards the glades:

One person on the path doesn't seem like an intrusion...

The Crested Knoll overlook was as far as we got:

After we returned to the car, we had the masala chai that I'd brought along in my extremely efficient Butterfly steel flask, it was still piping hot after 5 hours!

We left, with the glorious sunset bidding us goodbye:

This one's for <LJ user="asakiyume">.....doesn't this cut tree trunk (they cut several of the trees to re-establish the grasses in the glades) look like a fox to you?
