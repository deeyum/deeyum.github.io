<a href="http://s1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_7933-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1264.photobucket.com/albums/jj483/mnypx/IMG_7933-1.jpg" border="0" alt="ex ray muny 260612"></a>

Would this be the number plate of a radiologist's car (I snapped it at the Muny when I went to eee 

<a href=""> "Chicago" </a> .)

Would it be the number plate of someone who'd obtained a divorce from a guy called Raymond?

Would it be the number plate of someone who'd stopped wanting to tan in the sunshine?

Any other guesses?
