The lyrics:

Ap kE hasIn rukh pE Aj nayA noor hai
mErA dil machal gayA tO mErA kyA kusUr hai?
Ap kI nigAh nE kahA tO kucch zarUr hai
mErA dil machal gayA tO mErA kyA kusUr hai?

There is a new glow on your smiling face today..
How can I help it if my heart is stirred?
Your eyes are saying something, too...
How can I help it if my heart is stirred?

khulI latOn kI chAnv mEn khilA-khilA sA rUp hai
ghatA pE jaisE chhan rahI subah-subah kI dhUp hai
jidhar nazar mudI (2), udhar surUr hi surUr hai

In the shadow of your open tresses, your looks bloom
Like the morning sun filtering through the clouds.
Wherever your look passes, there is intoxication..

(merA dil)

jhukI-jhukI nigAh mEn bhI hain balA kI shOkhiyAn
dabI-dabI hansI mEn bhi tadap rahI hain bijliyAn
shabAb Ap kA(2) nashE mEn khud hi chUr-chUr hai

Your downcast look has so much of allure;
Your suppressed smiles are like throbbing lightning.
Your youth is, itself, thoroughly intoxicating....

(mErA dil)

jahAn-jahAn padE kadam, vahAn fizA badal gayI
ki jaisE sar-basar bahAr Ap hI mEn dhal gayI
kisI mEn yEh kashish(2) kahAn jO Ap mEn huzUr hai

Wherever your feet tread, the atmosphere changes
As if the entire spirit of spring resides in you.
No one else has the attraction which you possess...

(mEra dil)
