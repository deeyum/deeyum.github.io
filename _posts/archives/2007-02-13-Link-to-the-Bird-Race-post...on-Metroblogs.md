I've joined a Bangalore blog site called Metroblogs, in which people post city-specific entries; I have not yet learnt the ropes about posting photos and stuff on it, and am not entirely comfortable with the fact that posts on Metroblogs cannot be repeated on my LJ post, but I can only give the links to them. I will be trying it out for a little while, though.

Here's the link to my post about the Bird Race:

Feedback, of any kind, is, as always, welcome....and if other LJ'ers have joined Metroblogs before, I would like to know what their experience has been.
