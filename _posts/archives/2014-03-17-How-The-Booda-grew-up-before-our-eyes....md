Amazing what a difference hair makes to the appearance of a person...even when that person is just 14 months old!

That was Kalyan being shorn of his hair. My daughter wrote

about the first haircut...

Traditionally, the hair is offered in a temple, but the parents didn't want to do that.

So here we are at the haircutting "saloon", where "gents" get their hair cut:

AM admires the baby hair one last time:

Checks its length:

<lj-cut text="The process....">


The hair is wetted down:

He touches his wet head!

He isn't bothered at all:

The shearing begins:

The process is nearly complete, and is being documented by his father:

It was the elder sister who was more upset, and sitting with a crumpled-up face in a corner!

I had to come out and get her some mango juice and some chips; but then everyone came out, and we all had "orange kucchi ice" (orange juice sticks, utter sugar bombs!)

Our friend got a share, too:

We went to our friends' home, where he was bathed, and sandal paste applied to his little head:

He played quite happily, wearing his new shoes:

Within a few minutes, he went from being a little wispy-haired baby to being a little boy:

The full moon that night reminded me of his shiny, sandal-coloured head!
