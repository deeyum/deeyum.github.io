The 3rd Sunday bngbirds outing to Jigani Lake drew quite a good response, and we were happy to see the crowd that collected in front of the tea-shop at Jigani! (Geetanjali and Subir have a great knack of including a handy tea-shop in all the Bannerghatta outings!) The tea-shop was particularly welcome on this cold morning, and we all then parked near the lake, and walked partially around the perimeter.

Here's the sunrise on the lake:

Our sightings were varied and wonderful and my lifer was this

Here are most of us, with breakfast inside us, at Lotus Restaurant, Nisarga Layout, after the outing!

It was wonderful to have Subbu explain so much to us, especially some of the history of the lakes of Bangalore.
