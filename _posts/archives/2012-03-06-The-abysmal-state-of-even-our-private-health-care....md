Am very sad...but also boiling with anger and helplessness. Someone from the family who've practically brought me up had come to visit Chennai from Kolkata, where she lives. Last night she was unwell...and was taken by ambulance to Malar Hospital, where she was refused admission because, they said, they had a doctors' strike. After more confusion, during which critical time was lost, the ambulance had to take her to Royapettah Hospital...by that time, she passed away. 

I think the doctors at Malar Hospital have  probably murdered Murlidi. The family is getting on with the funeral....no one will probably chase this foul event up.....oh...I am boiling. HOW can a hospital refuse an emergency admission in the middle of the night?
