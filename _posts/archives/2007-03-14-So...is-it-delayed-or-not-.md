This was sent by someone on a mailing list I belong to, and I enjoyed it:

I do wish they would name trains that honestly!

And while you are here....here's another variety of the silk-cotton tree, called Bombax Ellipticum. This is the flower, which I had never seen before; my friend Jayashree, whom I took on the Lalbagh walk yesterday, showed it to me....how incredibly beautiful the flower is!

I am now subscribed to a wildflower egroup and a butterfly egroup, not because I know anything about them, but because the images are so fantastic! But occasionally, they give me some unexpected entertainment too. Did you know that there is a butterly called the Southern Duffer? I kid you not...
