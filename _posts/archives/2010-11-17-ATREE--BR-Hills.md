<a href="http://www.atree.org/"> ATREE </a> 

has a field station in BR Hills, and that was where we were bound, on the Valley School trip:

It didn't feel like a field station at all, it was so comfortable and welcoming!

Here are the staff at ATREE: Madhe Gowda, who will receive a doctorate shortly, and Nanje Gowda,...

Here they are, in the room that serves as the office:

I saw part of  a Soliga wedding video; the rites were fascinating:

The staff did not complain about the children's "monkey tricks"...even when they were swarming over the front gate!

When Chandu had to say bye reluctantly, the next day, the children all waved back:

That evening, ATREE organized a bonfire (though the wood was wet with the rain!)

A Soliga group came and danced for us; this is the tribal drum, being toasted over the fire to tighten the leather thongs:

Here are the dancers:

Of course, the food that the children got was very important, and it was local cuisine, and delicious. Here's Renukamma, who is in charge of the kitchen:

Here is the kitchen, with her helpers working:

Sometimes, we also helped out, here's the tea-boy Chandu!

Vegetables were chopped in huge quantities for the hungry little ones...here's the beetroot!

I should have photographed the idli, sambar and chutney before the attack of the children!

After breakfast, the idli cooker and steamer plates are washed and set out to dry....

Let me wind up with this picture of  Skanda, who is the co-ordinator for ATREE, for such trips and seminars...he's documenting the children at the temple!

Skanda certainly did a wonderful job on the first group from Valley School and will continue to do so for the other three groups who are following. 

Thank you very much, Skanda, and the staff of ATREE, for a great visit, and a lot of learning!
