I am really impressed by the way garbage is handled in Kodaikanal. Though the Kodai festival is one, and there is a huge influx of both day trippers as well as staying tourists, the lakeside area remains pretty clean, and I find a lot of pourakramiks/pourakramikas hard at work early in the morning, cleaning up the area. The lake, too, is remarkably plastic- and trash-free. Where there is a will, there is, indeed, a way.

No time, or indeed, the inclination, to go and sit in an internet parlour, especially because it means lugging my laptop there and then coming back to my hotel room, if I want to post pictures (I am using a Reliance card and it cannot be used to post pics.) I just love to walk around the lake or take a cycle (the basket holds the 20D, and the S3 too)....yes, it's crowded, but it's also very interesting!

I must come back home and  post the pic of "Caramel Custurd" (sic) that was served in our hotel....I know that <LJ user="skthewimp"> feels we are being elitist about finding humour in such misspellings, but I don't really agree with him, because I find these things humourous without necessarily feeling in any way superior to the people who put up the notices....and  in this case, it's a five-star hotel which, I think, should certainly get "custard" spelt properly, especially given the humour value of the last four letters as they have spelt them!
