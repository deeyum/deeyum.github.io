Took this as I was walking to Ranga Shankara for the theatre festival that began today...

The moon and the star
Look down,from afar
On friend and foe,
On darkness and light's glow;
They see peace,and war:
In the vastness of outer space,
Earth's problems have a trivial place..
How puny the humans of this world are!


Well, actually, that's Venus, not a star, but why spoil verse with veracity?


Saw an excellent production of the Hindi/Bengali play, "Nati Binodini"...but more of that later!
