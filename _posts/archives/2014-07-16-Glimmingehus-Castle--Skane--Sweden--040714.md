<a href="http://enjoysweden.se/en/object/glimmingehus-castle/"> Here </a>

is the site of Glimmingsehus Castle, in Hammenhog; it is a well-preserved medieval manor, the start of the construction of the fort dating back to 1499.

"Glimmingehus, situated in the county of Skåne in southern Sweden, is the best-preserved medieval manor in Scandinavia. Jens Holgersen Ulfstand began to construct the stately fortress in the year 1499.

 The present is on the left, and the past is on the right!

"Glimmingehus was established as an imposing residence for the Danish knight Jens Holgersen Ulfstand and his family. At that time Skåne belonged to Denmark.

"Finds from archaeological excavations have revealed the highly exclusive nature of the Glimmingehus household. The most expensive objects available in Europe in the early 16th century have been found, including Venetian glass, extruded Rhineland glass and Spanish ceramic ware.

"Today, Glimmingehus is a living Ancient Monument and a centre for people throughout Scandinavia interested in the Middle Ages, as well as an exciting outing. New research, both archaeological and research into building history, has helped to produce a picture of how the fortress was once built and used."

Even the lichen is blooming on the walls!

The well that served the castle; the story goes that there is an eel, about a thousand years old, that is still alive at the bottom! (No, we couldn't see into the well!)

I certainly remember grinding soaked rice in a similar grinding stone, when I was very young, in my parents' home in Kolkata!

An amazing fact at this castle was that even tourism is very old...here are the signatures of tourists from 1938!

PC was very taken with the moat, I think he wants one of his own, with crocodiles:

Another portrait (instead of oils, they used stone in those days!) of the Baron of the Castle:

I was amazed to find the 

<a href=""> Morching </a>

which we call the mOresing, and which is still played in many Carnatic music concerts:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/14618217921" title="IMG_3031 by mohandep, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14618217921_304778d85c_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_3031"></a>

It's apparently also called the "Jew's Harp" and is one of the oldest musical instruments in the world! Here's the castle employee playing it for us, being careful not to cut her tongue in two:

When medieval knights talked of chain mail, they didn't mean a spate of unwanted letters!

The museum had some (SO lightweight, made of nylon!) on sale:

They also had a lovely model of a slingshot cannon, and knights of old:

Now you know why there are no more unicorns, they've been made extinct!

Tourists are helping make each other extinct, too:

Imposing Glimmingehus Castle...thank you for taking us there, <lj user="kejn">!

Ofkose I have to talk about the birds, too....many of them make their homes here. We saw Swifts and Starlings, Ravens and Rooks, and many Jackdaws, like this one:

As we were leaving, we sighted a pair of Common Kestrels circling above the castle...and Kejn spotted three nestlings, in a niche, high above! What a thrill it was!

So that was my heritage-cum-birding experience here!
