It is the practice, at many temples to any goddess, to offer sarees as a votive offering to the deity. But when I visited the Melagiri forests, I saw this shrine that was actually constructed of sarees...

The inside of the shrine also had sarees in various hues, draped on the deity and kept nearby as well, a riot of colour:

I was unable to determine which goddess this was; I'm saree about that!
