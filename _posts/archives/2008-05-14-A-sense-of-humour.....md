I had sent out a test mail on one of the egroups that I moderate and asked for responses from everyone. Those who responded (alas, 32 out of a possible 97!) said, "Hi" or, 
"I am getting the mail on this id"

Except <LJ user="mamtanaidu"> who responded with, "I am not getting mail on this id!" and followed it up with an evil smiley.

I enjoy every interaction with that crazy young woman!
