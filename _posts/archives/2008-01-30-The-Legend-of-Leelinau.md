While in the World Bird Sanctuary/Lone Elk Park area, we saw this...and it was really striking.

Our religion and mythology is replete with the spirits that infuse other things found in Nature, so I loved this legend:

And then we looked up the tree on which this sign was, and there was Leelinau herself, her hair trailing down like Rapunzel's....

Here she is, a little closer:

That was lovely, though a little sad...I think the world is always against love that defies the "norms"...and often, people who love that way suffer for it.
