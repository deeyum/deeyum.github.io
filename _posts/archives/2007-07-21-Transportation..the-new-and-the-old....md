A snap of the road leading away from the Ranganathittu river landing...

I like the way the CR-V is right next to our age-old form of transportation, the bullock cart, laden with palm fronds which will be used for fuel, to to make a thatched roof....

I love the beauty of the banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis), an ethnic tree, that spreads over the road, casting welcome shade....

It's a beautiful, calm evening. Somewhere, beyond, the rushing world whizzes past, but here it's peace and quiet, punctuated only by the cowbells and birdsong. 

Sunrise and sunset are, to me, really wonderful times.
