Bateshwar, on the Yamuna, near Chambal, 280111.


Lost in their world
The children play;
They've not yet been hurled
Into the harsh realities of life.
What appears to a grown up
As a blank wall
Is actually shown up
In a child's mind
As a treasured find:
When they're small
And free from strife,
They can get away...
Into a magic realm of their own...
Where they are alone
With their imagination. When
I see them, I wish they'd remain
Forever children
Dwelling in that hidden domain...


Off to see the Aero Show at Yelahanka tomorrow..
