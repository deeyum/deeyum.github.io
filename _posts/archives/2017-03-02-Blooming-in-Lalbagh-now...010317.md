Several blooms to delight the  senses!


A walk in Lalbagh is always something that will bring a lot of joy. I decided to capture some of the blossoms that appealed to my eyes, my nose, my touch, and sometimes, as they rustled in the morning breeze, to my ears, too! Some of them are quite uncommon...but can all be found in the park.


The Purple Bauhinia (Bauhinia blakena)

These are the flowers of the Cabbage Bark Tree (Andira inermis)

The Pride of Bolivia (Tipuana tipu)

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/32340034834/in/album-72157679267198770/" title="IMG_9268"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/573/32340034834_82cffda898.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_9268"></a>

It tickles me that a tree which is apparently called after the Tiger of Mysore should have the common name, Pride of Bolivia!

One of the many cultivars (cultivated flowers, not wild ones) in the flower beds:

Here’s the “octopus” flowers of the Umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla), just beginning to bud:

Children, as well as birds, love to sip the drop of  nectar that can be found at the base of the Rangoon Creeper (Combretum indicum):

The flowers have a lovely, heady fragrance, too.

Another variety of the Bauhinia, this time, a creeper (Bauhinia alba)

The delicate blooms of the Silk-cotton tree (Ceiba pentandra)

The flowers of the Weeping Boer-bean (Schotia brachypetala)

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/albums/72157679267198770/with/33057416611/" title="IMG_9220"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2925/33028503422_55f3c49376.jpg" width="500" height="297" alt="IMG_9220"></a>

Sometimes even the seed pods are as beautiful at the flowers. Here is the fruit of the Pithraj tree:

The purple of the Jacaranda (Jacarada mimosifolia)  is a harbinger of  “vasanta ritu”that is just begiinning.

The Kanaka Champa (Pterospermum acerifolium) is another beauty to behold:

Finally, here is one of the most beautiful…. the Philippine Jade Vine (Strongylodon macrobotrys)   that blooms annually at this time.

All these photos were taken in Lalbagh on 1st March 2017.These are only a few of the many flowers you can see right now...so do go and visit our beautiful public park, and enjoy the flowers in one of our lung spaces.
