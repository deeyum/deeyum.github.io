I took KTB to the playground,
And there in a hollow on a nearby tree, 
Two very beady eyes
Were looking out at me!

For her alertness and worry
I soon saw the reason;
The baby squirrel peeped out with her mother:
Successful breeding season!

I do like urban wildlife as much as I like forest wildlife.
