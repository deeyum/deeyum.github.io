I was lucky enough to go to the same area in the Bannerghatta Forest...on Saturday, approaching it from Kaggalipura, and on Sunday, from Bannerghatta. On Saturday, the

BLACK EAGLE

obliged with a sighting, against the dark and rainy sky:

but on Sunday, it absented itself!

here's my fellow-birder on Saturday, hard at work documenting the Baya Weaver colony...he made a great picture against the the lilies and the lantana!

Here are some of us on Sunday,  enjoying the "dog" biscuits (the dog got one packet, but we managed ..without jumping in the air, as Chandu pointed out!....most of the second...

The tree over the pond was not only the site of an active colony of

BAYA WEAVERS:

but also attracted SILVERBILLS, and some

WHITE-RUMPED MUNIAS:

A PEEPAL tree nearby had these

SCALY-BREASTED MUNIAS:

On the pond, a

PIED WAGTAIL 

strutted about, showing why it was so called!

On another water body, Rohit and I spotted this

LITTLE GREBE (DABCHICK):

A

PIED KINGFISHER suddenly came and sat on the wire, and all the DSLR's went into action, but my little MLC caught it flying off:

As we were going home on Sunday, we got this 

JERDON'S BUSHLARK,

larking about in the bush!

You can hear its clear high song....

Both days, I enjoyed the sight of the bees in the lilies:

This 

SIAM CASSIA (Cassia Siamea) tree was a magnet for many birds:

I couldn't id this insect on the rock, though...

310710"></a>

but obviously, this 

ROCK AGAMA
 
would have id'd it as breakfast!

I liked the pattern made by the steps beyond the kalyANi...they were lined by saplings of the 

INDIAN CORK TREE (Akasha malligE)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_8825.jpg" border="0" alt="steps from kalyANi 310710"></a>

Abhijna id'd this tiny beauty as a

PALE GRASS BLUE:

I was able to id this 

BARONET 

with its wings closed,

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_8827.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_8827.jpg" border="0" alt="baronet closed 310710"></a>

..but was doubtful when it opened, and had to go home to confirm the id!

With this kind of  variety...and the lovely cloudy cool weather, the greenery of the forest area, and good friends... there's not the least doubt about the wonderful mornings I had...and on Sunday evening, I went for the equally enjoyable Ancient Light photowalk, about which, more later!
