I was struck by the grace and serenity of this statue of the Buddha at the Art Museum:

and found this installation intriguing...

Er,I feel I could have painted that as well as the artist did!




....but outside the building, I loved to see  the beauty of this griffon on the roof of the museum:

A thing of beauty is a joy forever...but so is an installation which brings the artist plenty of money!
