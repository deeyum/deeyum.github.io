We adults had events all chalked out...we'd go boating in Forest Park. We finished our activity, the children did enjoy it...but while we were waiting for our cars, KTB and her friend Ananya ran around the grass, playing so happily...

They were joined by two more girls, who never worried about who they were, and just joined in. Here's one of them:

This was, truly, frolicking in the grass:

Life IS a bed of clover, that can be picked:

Thinking of mischief, perhaps...

The children didn't bother about structured "activity"...they enjoyed whatever time they had, without thinking twice about it...it was such a delight watching them frisking in the grass and tearing around.
