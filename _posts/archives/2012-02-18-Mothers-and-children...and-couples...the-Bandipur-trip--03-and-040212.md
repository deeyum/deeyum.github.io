I've always seen that Bandipur is one place where I find so many mothers with the children....whatever the creature may be. Here are a few mothers and children that I saw on this trip, with

Loved the sight of this 

CHITAL

doe, lovingly licking her fawn:

<lj-cut text="Want to see more?">

I saw several

HANUMAN LANGUR

mothers with their babies, carrying them, not backpack, but frontpack:

I got one a little closer...

And could zoom in enough on my MLC, on to the tiny little mite in the arms of the mother.

Eyes closed, and so blissfully ignorant of the dangers of life....touches the heart to see it.

At Ramnagara, on the 3rd, we saw the delightful sight of a baby

LONG-BILLED VULTURE:

There are only a very few of the adults left in south India, here's one which is probably the mother:

(Unless, of course, I've snapped the father or the uncle or the aunt!)

This 

ELEPHANT

had also brought her calf to drink water at the pond we visited:

And we saw another one, ushering her little one along:

Of course, a lovely sighting was of a 

 with her cubs; here's the mother, called "Gauri":

and here's a short video of one of the cubs crossing over to join the mother and a sibling (the other two were already in the undergrowth):

You can hear the clicking of a dozen shutters, a zillion times!

Well, I must also say I watched a pair of

STREAK-THROATED WOODPECKERS

the female, in a lovely yellowish-green raiment,

and the male, with his red "cap":

We saw two 

MALABAR GIANT SQUIRRELS

together...

Hopefully, these couples should also bring forth babies shortly!

What a beautiful place Bandipur is.....
