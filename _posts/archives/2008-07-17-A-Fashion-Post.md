I also realize I rarely do fashion posts....so here's the latest in monsoon headgear, as demonstrated by my daughter (it's just sheer coincidence that this top model is related to me by blood ties.)

This is, ladies and genmun, a very eco-friendly fashion statement...it uses up those plastic bags that would otherwise go and pollute the environment...

The dowdy frump...is the one taking the photograph!
