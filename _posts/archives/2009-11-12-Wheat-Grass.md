One of the things I have been introduced to lately, is 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatgrass">Wheat Grass </a>

 and wheat grass juice....

I am hoping that this has a very beneficial effect as an ill person has this every day with two spoons of 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey"> honey </a>

I have learnt how to grow this on the balcony; soak the wheat grains overnight, let them drain in a cloth until they sprout, and then scatter them in a pot which has mud and fertilizer....


Here, you can see the various stages of its growth:

The wiki says spinach is just as good, but the green of that grass is definitely soothing to the eye as well!
