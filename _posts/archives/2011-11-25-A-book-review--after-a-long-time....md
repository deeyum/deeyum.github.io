I used to review books for the Indian Review of Books, long ago, in Chennai. Then I gave it up, for what reason, I still do not know...but after a very long time, another book review of mine, which I had put up in Citizen Matters, earlier,made it into print in the Deccan Herald,

Sadhana's book is a very handy guide for those who want to know the names of common urban trees...and all that surrounds them!
