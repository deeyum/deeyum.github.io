Balloons are a child's delight, and it is a delight to buy them for a child, too. I got two for KTB, and here is KTB herself, on her date of birth, with her Nana, and the balloons:

So of course I had fun while bringing them home....first I snapped them:

And then I realized that they were throwing their colour on the sidewalk, so I got that, too:

I may never be a good or artistic photographer, but I certainly have fun with my MLC!
