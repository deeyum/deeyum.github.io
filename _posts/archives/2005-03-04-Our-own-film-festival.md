We have been having our own film festival...we suddenly realized that 
THREE<BR>Oscar nominees were running in the same multiplex...so it was Aviator 
on Sunday, Black (a Hindi movie about a deaf-blind girl and her 
alcoholic teacher....Rani Mukherjee and Amitabh) on Monday, Tuesday Swades (a 
sickly sweet Hindi movie), Wednesday Finding Neverland (another 
sentimental melodrama) Thursday, Ray...the last movie was really 
excellent...both the acting by Jamie Foxx, who really lived the part of Ray 
Charles....and the superb R&B and country music throughout the 
movie....tomorrow is a rest day, and then we take 3 children from our 
apartment to The Incredibles!

tickets at this multiplex are 130 rupees 
apiece, snacks can easily set you back another 300, and then there are the 
parking charges....yow!
