I go thinking that I'll see a nice bird, that's the Beliefbird; 
I finally spot a bird that others have seen five minutes ago, that's the Reliefbird; 
There's one bird that's the highlight of the morning, that's the Chiefbird;  
There's one that I fail to see, that's the Griefbird; 
There's the bird that steals my heart, that's the Thiefbird;
I spot a bird for just a few seconds, that's the Briefbird;
The bird that poops on my head, that's the Mischiefbird....

...Why don't the ornithologists list all these, along with the Leafbird!
