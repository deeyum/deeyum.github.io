...I'm not sure if this is the smallest bird in India, but it must be one of the smallest. It's also a very common bird....but it's so incredibly beautiful!

They come out when the sun does, and so, their name is rather apt, along with the fact that the sunshine brings out their wonderful colours....

This is the

PURPLE-RUMPED SUNBIRD

and this one is a male, on the leaves of the Rain Tree.
