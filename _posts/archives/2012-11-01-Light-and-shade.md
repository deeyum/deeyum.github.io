Timber Depot, Dandeli, Karnataka, 251012

The sun slants into the grove
In a million rays.
The leaves take beauty
In a million ways.
We, who see it, cannot hope to create
A hundredth part of such a scene.
We can only capture and share...
And be awed by what we have seen.

A salute to Karnataka, my home,my mother,  and my muse...She came into being on this day.
