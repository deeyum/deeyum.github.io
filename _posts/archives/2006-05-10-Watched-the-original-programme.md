Remember the snow leopard footage that I referred to in an earlier post? Well, <LJ user="Amoghavarsha"> used his geek skills to tape the original programme (BBC Planet Earth) and yesterday we (Amogh, Sanath and <LJ user="kalyan">) watched it...in fact the whole programme, called "Mountains", was pretty stunning, though the volume was very low.

Any of you who are interested...both Kalyan and Amogh have it now.

This has also been posted to the JLRNTP-1 egroup. (Those of us who took the Naturalists' Training Program run by JLR.)
