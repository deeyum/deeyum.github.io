It was raining heavily in the morning; the afternoon was filled with bright, hot sunshine; the evening had both sunshine and rain, and so this resulted:

We were able to see half the circle, but it's beyond the scope of my MLC (Canon S3) to capture it...

In Hindu mythology, the rainbow is the bow of Indra. Indra's weapon is the Vajra or thunderbolt; he associates with Vaayu, the wind god, and Varun, the god of rain. Indra, by the way, is a "designation", any god with the right qualifications can become Indra.

Oh, and there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbow"> moonbows </a>, too...I have seen one in <a href="http://www.2geton.net/martin/moonbow/"> Cumberland, Kentucky </a>...the one I saw was very faint, nothing like the pictures in that link!
