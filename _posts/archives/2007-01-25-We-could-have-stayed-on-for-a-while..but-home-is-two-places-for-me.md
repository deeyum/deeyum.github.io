Feeling irritated. The seminar that KM (and hence, I too) rushed home for, which he had put in a lot of work organizing, has been postponed...they called him to tell him this yesterday. If not for this seminar, we would definitely have stayed on a few more weeks with DnA; they would have been so happy, too, to have someone to come home to, in the dreary winter evenings; and since KM and I are very much at home and completely able to get about by ourselves, it wouldn't have been difficult for us, either. So, of course, we get to know now...

We were just congratulating ourselves on remaining awake through yesterday (KM actually did a day of work) and waking up at a sensible hour in the morning; then, at about 11am, I went to sleep as I sat on the sofa, and was dead to the world till 5 pm, when I finally went and bought some fruit and things for the household. It was so LOVELY to see my beloved 9th block again...there is some "Brihat Hindu Mahotsav" going on, and there are garlands up near the arch of the Ragigudda Temple...and it was SO nice buying fruits out in the open air instead of in an air-conditioned (or heated) supermarket, and smiling at my flower-vendor friend who asked after my daughter. I grumbled at the potholes on the roads as my cycle bumped over them. 

<LJ user="travelertrish"> wanted to have my feedback on coming back again. Well, Trish...I think I am really at home in both the US as well as here. The systems are different in the two places; here one keeps asking for help to do one's work, there one keeps gathering the information that will allow one to do it. But once one gets the hang of it, one just shifts from one system to the other. Each way of life has its own advantages...and drawbacks.  

I loved my evening gossip,today, on the landing with the residents of the other three flats on my side of the landing (I live on the 4th floor); I distributed chocolates to the children; though I am still tired and in pain from my facial injury, I felt so at home and at peace...it is difficult to understand how it can be, but I *am* equally at home and at ease in both worlds. I think I have to thank my daughter and son-in-law largely for this. Their home is so comfortable, so organized and so welcoming. I feel as much a part of their household as, I hope, they feel in mine.
