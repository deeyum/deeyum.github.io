The 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-winged_Kite"> BLACK-WINGED KITE </a>

(earlier called the Black-Shouldered Kite, which I think is more accurate)

is easily one of the most handsome common accipiters in the Bangalore outskirts....

You can see the black shoulders clearly as it lands on the insulators of the power cables:

It's rare to get a photograph of them on anything but a wire, so here's one I got:

I was barely able to get the bird in the frame as it flew:
