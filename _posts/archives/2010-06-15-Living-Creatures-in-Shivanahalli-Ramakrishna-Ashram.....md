KM's scan is over, and he seems quite OK, but we have to wait for the doctor's arrival and his verdict that we can, indeed, go home and resume our usual-abnormal life....but meanwhile, KM's laptop and his Reliance card means that I can use my time to document the various life-forms we saw at Shivanahalli...

Let me start with the beautiful 

TICKELL'S BLUE FLYCATCHER

that came out on the overcast, dull morning to sing for us and the children:

<lj-cut text="lots of creatures if you click here">

There were no startlingly new birds, but it was so nice to see all my old birds again and check if I did, indeed, remember their names!

I got this silhouette, against the rainy sky, of a

SMALL GREEN BEE-EATER with breakfast (not a bee, but a Dragonfly!)

this female

ASIAN KOEL

looked mottled and beautiful in the leaves:

Another breakfast eater was this

INDIAN BUSHLARK:

Almost at the end of the morning, this

ORIENTAL HONEY BUZZARD

floated past, with its typical pigeon-shaped head:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6353.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6353.jpg" border="0" alt="ohb120610"></a>


And then we also spotted this

LARGE GREY BABBLER

with others, on the wire:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6367.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6367.jpg" border="0" alt="large grey babbler 120610"></a>


There was, indeed, a very large raptor that landed in the trees as we were driving back, but oncoming traffic ensured that we could not see it properly before it disappeared.


Butterflies and insects of various kinds were around....

My friend 

<a href="http://birdsonthebrainetc.wordpress.com"> Uma </a> says this is a

MONKEY PUZZLE (this is my first sighting of one, then!)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6276.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6276.jpg" border="0" alt="un id silverline 120610"></a>


Here's a 

RED PIERROT:

this one's some type of YELLOW:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6237.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6237.jpg" border="0" alt="un id yellow bfly 120610"></a>

it was the children who showed us this beautiful insect which had pupated and was just about to come out of its shell:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6266.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6266.jpg" border="0" alt="un id larva 120610"></a>

and Chandu showed the children this 

CRICKET

and explained how it made its chirping sound:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6272.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6272.jpg" border="0" alt="cricket 120610"></a>

I found this un id, but beautiful insect on a leaf:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6306.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6306.jpg" border="0" alt="un id insect on leaf 120610"></a>

and then found this yellow-and-black beetle scuttling off in a great hurry (camera-shy, no doubt!)


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6270.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6270.jpg" border="0" alt="un id yellowblack beetle 120610"></a>


A 

LUNA MOTH

sat on a leaf:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6311.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6311.jpg" border="0" alt="luna moth 120610"></a>

and an ANT was busy carrying off another dead one to its lair:

A

DUNG BEETLE

was busy at work, interring another dead insect:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6322.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6322.jpg" border="0" alt="dung beetle 120610"></a>


We were zapped to see these

MEALY BUGS

under the leaves of some of the trees:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6343.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6343.jpg" border="0" alt="120610 aphids under leaf"></a>


Even a plain 

FLY

looked so beautiful!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6278.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6278.jpg" border="0" alt="fly shivanahalli ashram"></a>

The only reptile we saw was this 

ROCK AGAMA:




<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6243.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6243.jpg" border="0" alt="rock agama 120610"></a>

Even the plants around were quite lovely, as were these red 

UN ID BERRIES

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6273.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6273.jpg" border="0" alt="red berries 120610"></a>


(Though the Ashram grows coffee, Aishwarya Belliappa tells me these are different berries.)


This reddish flower looked lovely,

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6302.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6302.jpg" border="0" alt="un id small reddish flower 120610"></a>

as did this whitish one:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6312.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6312.jpg" border="0" alt="un id whitish flower"></a>

These little flowers blazed with blue:

And we enjoyed the smell of this 

WILD JASMINE:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6308.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6308.jpg" border="0" alt="wild jasmine 120610"></a>


Fat 

MUSHROOMS grew everywhere with the rains:

<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6356.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6356.jpg" border="0" alt="mushroom 120610"></a>

and some of them looked like fruits!


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6316.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6316.jpg" border="0" alt="un id mushrooms orange"></a>


I couldn't id this one, though:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6319.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6319.jpg" border="0" alt="un id fruit 120610"></a>

It seemed to me that

VANILLA PODS

were being cultivated, but the children couldn't help us on this:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_6317.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_6317.jpg" border="0" alt="vanilla pods?"></a>


So we just enjoyed the flowers as we saw them....

</lj-cut>


We even enjoyed the geometry of this uprooted tree as we walked back from the Ashram, heading homewards.
