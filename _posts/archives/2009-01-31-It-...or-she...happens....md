A girlfriend is the nice, reliable, comfort-giving young woman  that happens to a young man while he  is eagerly awaiting a Hot Chick.

 ( A Hot Chick is this totally sexy female, who, the young man  fondly imagines, is going to look at him, particularly, in a crowd of handsome and rich hulks!).


And what, meanwhile, if you are not Born to Lead, but only Bord?

At least if you had an "e" in the word, you could shrug your shoulders and say you were Bored to Lead.

And if you're not careful,you will buy a Fony Walkman:

I do love going around with my MLC!
