Today, KM pinched the Deccan Herald first (I usually read the paper, finish the crossword and give it to him to take on the drive to Hosur.)...so, while Skyping with KTB, I decided to try my hand at the BS (well-named!) 

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/737251.html"> cryptic crossword </a>

again. I don't want to say I don't like because I can't do it! So I did complete it, but still feel that the answers are not really great...what on earth is that "Twofold Yap" (9 across)? I *know* it is the answer, but it makes no sense to me.

However, I *am* satisfied that I can complete it...now, I am introspecting to see whether this is an egoistic feeling...
