The deepest truths are the simplest ones; our ancients used telling examples from everyday life to illustrate them.


Here's a flower that needs no introduction:

And here's the water upon its leaf:

And the profound truth is, live your life as the lotus and its leaf do...they are both born of the water and of the filth and stagnation (neera-ja, panka-ja) and are yet not of it. From the stagnation and the filth they rise, but  yet they are incredibly beautiful. They allow the water to touch them, but not moisten them; the water rolls away from the leaf or the flower, which is untouched. And yet, they feed on that self-same water, and draw sustenance from a Force Above as well.

What simple advice..and HOW very difficult to heed in one's life!

This one is for <LJ user="nearfar">, who sends me a lot of pointers which I am unable to yet accept wholly...
