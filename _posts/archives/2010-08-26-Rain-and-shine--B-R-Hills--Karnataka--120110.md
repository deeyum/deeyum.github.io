Rain and shine are a part of life...each has its own beauty.
Varuna and Surya both alternate, in doing their appointed duty.

<lj-cut text="rain..and then the sun....">

We'd gone for the JLRNTP meet, and it poured and poured and poured.
This Crested Serpent Eagle sat sodden...a bird that usually soared.

Slowly the downpour eased up a bit.The first rays of the sun
Shone on the water...though just yet, the rain was not quite done.

Then from behind the heavy clouds, the sun came out in glory.
I hope that you too have enjoyed my jungle rain-shine story!

What a pity it is that the sunset's lovelier, the more the level of pollution.
How can we keep this beauty while cleaning the world up? Do you have a solution?
