Tamizh Brahmins, or Tambrams, are very fond of diamonds, and women are usually aglitter with them during any festivities.


I loved the sight of this beauty, with her diamond earrings and diamond nose-studs....

The traditional diamond earring is called a "thOdu"; it has a central stone with six other stones set around it.

Under the thOdu, this young woman is wearing an umbrella-shaped gold ornament called the  "jimikki", or "kuNdalam".

The nose-stud is called a "bEsari". This one, because it has 4 stones underneath, is called "nAlu kal bEsari."

Isn't the Diamond Beauty stunning?
