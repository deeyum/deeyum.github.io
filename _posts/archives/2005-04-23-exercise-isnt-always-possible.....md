I have an hour to spare, before I must dress up and go to visit two people in succession. But I can't go for a walk as that would leave me dripping with sweat, and a bath wouldn't really freshen me up. Neither can I go for a swim, as my eyes go red with the chlorine, and I couldn't wear my contact lenses, without which I don't feel dressed...so...here I am, sitting and wasting time on the internet....

Or am I making facile excuses??
