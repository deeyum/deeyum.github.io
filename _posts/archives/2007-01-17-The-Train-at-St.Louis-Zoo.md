A lovely train which visitors ride,
At the St Louis Zoo;
It's not big, it's not wide,
But it will take all of you.

Around the Zoo it chugs along,
Bells clanging at the crossing;
The engineer waves to the visiting throng,
And they wave back at him, pausing.

Two flags flutter upon its head,
One is the famous Old Glory;
The other one,blue, white and red,
Is the flag of Missouri.

"Instead of walking around the Zoo,
It's great to board it with children.."
Say tired parents and grandparents, who
Enjoy the Zoo a little more,then!
