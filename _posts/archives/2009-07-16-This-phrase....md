I have seen only Indians using the words, "your end"...as in "What's happening at your end?" or "Hope everything's OK at your end".

This phrase really cracks me up, because I read it literally and it brings up hilarious images.

I have two ends; one is for talking and putting food in, and the other....well, I don't want to talk about it.

But when I'm asked if everything is fine at my end, I want to ask, "which end do you mean? the one which talks, or the one I am sitting on (which also talks sometimes)?"

And when I think of someone, other than a proctologist, enquiring after my other end, well, that's when I start laughing helplessly!
