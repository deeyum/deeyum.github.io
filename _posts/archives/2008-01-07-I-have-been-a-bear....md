One of my LJ friends come to Bangalore and has not contacted me ... I have been rather perplexed and hurt....so I have been a bear to another one who came to visit, too, and who, I think, would most certainly have contacted me if possible....sorry, JS.

I am trying to understand that people like different degrees of distance in their friendships, and I should respect that.
