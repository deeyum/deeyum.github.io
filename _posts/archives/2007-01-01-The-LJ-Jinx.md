I have been trying to meet so many LJ-ers...<LJ user="beast_666">, (return times to his town \from Portland, Maine, didn't work)  then <LJ user="enigmaticash"> (family/wedding commitments didn't leave us enough time to visit herin Hartford, enroute to our flight out of Boston), then <LJ user="asakiyume"> (either we, or she, would have needed to do a 4 hour drive to meet) , and now,  <LJ user="varshax">(who is too unwell to do the train ride to LA) and lastly, <LJ user="wondernoon">(who seems to be out of town and has not answered my messages so far though I am scheduled to visit her tomorrow)....so far, it's been unmitigated non-success....

I suppose I should learn the lesson that there is a REASON why people on LJ don't meet in person! Making all the phone calls and setting up all these meetings, with back-and-forth calls to the local hosts, has taken up so much time and effort...only to end in nought!
