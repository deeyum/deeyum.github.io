Posting something on LJ on a Saturday is a good idea, it keeps me from the watchful eyes of all the IT geeks in this city who log off for the weekend and will trawl the net only come Monday morning....

Will probably be meeting many LJ-ers over this weekend, and they can't comment on what they haven't seen yet!
