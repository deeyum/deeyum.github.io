It was an NTP outing.... I accompanied Radha and  Shreeram to Lalbagh this morning. 

We did see a lot of interesting things,but I want to first  share our morning tryst with One,Two, and Three...the Spotted Owlets!

<lj-cut text="Want to see....One, Two, Three?"> 

We saw One first, on the Jacaranda tree...

Left and right, went the poses.

The Two flew into the hole in the tree-trunk (probably it is a nest)


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4358.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4358.jpg" border="0" alt="owlt hole 1 130511 lb"></a>

From there, we got several looks:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4365.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4365.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>


Then the two flew up to sit side by side, though, of course, one of them was mooning us:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4369.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4369.jpg" border="0" alt="two owlts frnt back b 130511"></a>


Then both decided to be rude:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4373.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4373.jpg" border="0" alt="two owlts bk view lb 130511"></a>


But they were happy together, preening each other:

<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_4374.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/IMG_4374.jpg" border="0" alt="two owlts prng  b 130511"></a>

So of course, we circled round the tree to get a better view:

They looked adorable:

How much can one bend its head?

Then THREE also appeared, sitting on a branch:

We left them to themselves, very reluctantly indeed, these little feather-balls!
