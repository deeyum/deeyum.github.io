Here are some recordings I did with "Evoca" which <lj user="mewpsych"> told me about. The quality of the recordings is not great as my computer microphone picks up ambient noise I think...but it was fun to do! I haven't edited anything either, so What You Hear is What You Get! Give me the deef...that's "feed back"!

 thanks for the correction of the URL <LJ user="sunson">!

Will be posting the lyrics and their meanings in my next post...
