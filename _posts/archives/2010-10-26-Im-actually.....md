Did you think this is just a lizard,
Basking  in the sun?
Did you think it would catch some flies
And the  whole day's work is done?

No indeed...it is a wizard.
It is  a po-li-tician.
Whichever the way the votes seem to go..
That's the way it will run.

How can you spot who it is? you ask.
Reader..don't be dense!
Can you not see...quite easily...
That it's....sitting on the fence?
