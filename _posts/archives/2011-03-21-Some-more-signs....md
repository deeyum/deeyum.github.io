On our way around Mathigiri,and Denkanikotta, I spotted a lot of interesting stuff....

Not only are some people willing to arrange your wedding for you, they are also willing to keep your marriage going, so if you want a marriage designer...

Would you like a word for your milk?

I never got to finding out how they parcel tea and coffee:

Once again, I marvelled at the need to put up news of marriages and deaths on the public highway:

Finally, here's a god that most of us propitiate regularly:

Having an MLC is an undiluted delight!
