In the following narrative, I am not sure how Mukesh plans to drive to work from the 3rd floor...but....on with the story!

Mukesh Ambani in his 27 storeyed House

Mukeshbhai wakes up n his bedroom on 15th floor, takes a swim in the swimming pool on 17th floor, has breakfast on the 19th floor, dresses up for office on 14th floor, collects his files and office bag from his personal office on 21st floor, says bye to Nitabhabhi on 16th floor, says 'See You' to his children on 13th floor, and goes down on 3rd floor to self drive his 2.5 Crore Mercedes to office, but then.... he finds out that he has forgotten the car keys upstairs. But on which floor? 15th, 17th,19th,14th,21st,16th or 13th ?

He phones all his servants, cooks, maids, secretaries, pool attendants, gym trainers, etc. on all the floors. There is a hectic search and lot of running about on all the floors, but the key is not traceable. Fed up, after half an hour, Mukeshbhai leaves in a chauffeur driven ordinary Ikon car.

At 3.30 P.M. it is discovered that 4 days back, a temporary replacement maid had washed Mukeshbhai's trousers,  and hung them  to dry on a line in the balcony of 16th floor, with car keys in the pockets. The trousers  had blown away somewhere in the high winds at 16th floor level and were never found. This was found out because of Nitabhabhi's habit of personally  checking clothes given for ironing.

After 3 days Nitabhabhi complains to Mukeshbhai, "Where were you roaming till 3 A.M. last night ?"

Mukeshbhai says he was at home all night.

"Then why did the helicopter land on the terrace at 3 am?  I was so worried, I could not sleep whole night," says Nitabhabhi.

"Oh...that helicopter? It was sent  from Germany by the Mercedes people... to deliver the duplicate car key."
