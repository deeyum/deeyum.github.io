We went to see the Chinese Festival at the Missouri Botanical Center, and here's the video of the jugglers...



<lj-embed id="44"/>

They set those plates spinning on the canes, one by one, and then set the plates on the tables spinning,too..there are 24, in all, isn't that amazing!

The video is 2'23" long..but I think it's worth watching!
