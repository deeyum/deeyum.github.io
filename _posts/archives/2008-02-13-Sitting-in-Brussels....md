Ah, the joys of technology....wifi hotspot at Brussels...

I was watching that great favourite Hindi movie, "Jewel Thief" on the flight...the song,

"Yeh dil na hOthA bEchArA
kadam na hothEy AwArA
jo khoobsoorath kOi apnA
humsafar hOthA"

was subtitled as

"If my heart was heeded
If my heart was not astray
I would have a beautiful companion".

I thought the translation should be the OTHER way around...

"I would not have a neglected heart
and my steps would not go astray
if I had a beautiful fellow-traveller of my own..."


What do you think? Sree, especially...?
