The person who wanted to become Chief Minister of our beautiful State took this very scientific route:

He was told by a numerology specialist (er, he might be a name-ologist too...) that if he changed the spelling of his name from Yeddiyurappa to Yeddyurappa, he would become the CM. So that's what he did.

And he DID become the <strike> cheap </strike> chief minister...for a period of...a few  days.I am sure he thinks of these days as a yeddy time....

Ah, we lucky citizens, to have our State administered by such Yeddy bears...
We also have that great man, who lives in a light-citron-coloured concoction across the road from where I live, who thinks nothing of dissolving marriages as soon as they are created...
