Who will drop loving kisses
On the cheeks of motherless children?
Who will hug them, tease them, scold them,
Dance with them, sing to them,
Tickle them, cuddle them, laugh with them?
Children need food and sleep...
And so much more, to thrive.
I sing two little children to sleep.
Tears fall from my eyes as I think
Of every child without parents in this world.
The refugees, the orphans, the lost children....
Surely the greatest cruelty in our world
Is to let children live.... without love.
