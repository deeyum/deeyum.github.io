Dear LJ friends...

Please don't send email to my Yahoo id. I check it very rarely, and even more rarely now that BSNL is putting me through a crapola time with the connection. I just managed to get online and decided to check my Yahoo id and found one wedding invitation, one dinner invitation, and the phone no. of someone who wants to meet with me and must be wondering why on earth I am not calling.

So please...use my gmail id for all communication. I am almost weaned off my dataone id, too, uzliss as it is.
