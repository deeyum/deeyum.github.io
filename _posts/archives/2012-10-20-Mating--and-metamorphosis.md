With two million legs
Love can be complicated.
But one million legs
Travel over the ground
To find the other million...
Together, the millipedes curl up
In a paisley of love.
They blend into each other's curves
In that conch-shape embrace:
Watching them, I wonder...
Perhaps some of those legs are arms
That hold each other close?

Surely the most mysterious
Transformation of all...
When a worm turns into a shining case
From which emerges, wondrously,
A delicate creature of colour, and air.
Here's the metallic sheen
Of a pupa, in which
The body, head and wings
Are developing.
Given the beauty of the pupa,
Isn't it ironic
That what will emerge from it
Is going to be a butterfly
That's called the Common Crow?
