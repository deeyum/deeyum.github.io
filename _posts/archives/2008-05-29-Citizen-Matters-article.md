This time Citizen Matters took a little while to get the article to "go live"...I guess they have a lot of material to manage, now!

I am giving a presentation on behalf of Clean and Green about plastic and its management.... at Wipro, at their Electronic City location, tomorrow, with <LJ user="anushsh">. I have never, ever, done a powerpoint presentation before....am somewhat nervous, hope that my tongue doesn't get entangled in my tonsils!
