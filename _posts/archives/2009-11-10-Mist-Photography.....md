This was the scene at the nursery area:

The majestic trees made a

Right overhead was a display of the vault of heaven, clothed in mist:

Some young trees made a fractal silhouette:

And just to see how it would look, I decided to take one image of the passing scenery through the rain-washed window of the car:
