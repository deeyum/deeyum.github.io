I got this lovely pic from <lj user="itsalouwelylife"> who was chatting with D, A and KTB on Skype and took a webshot.


For some reaon, everyone has a chin-in-hand (maybe a chin in hand is better than two in the bush?)...so...Merry Chinmas to all of you!

Off to Devarayanadurga and Maidanahalli today; with 16 of us, it's going to be a wonderful time!
