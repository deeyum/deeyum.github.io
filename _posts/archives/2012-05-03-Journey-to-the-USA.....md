Life-changing....that's the right way to describe events in my life, lately, and part of the process is a journey to the USA, where I will stay for 2.5 months. I don't want to talk about all of it now, but I'd certainl like to share one of my favourite parts of the awful, tiring trans-Atlantic travel...the View Out of the Window.

I managed, somehow, to get good window seats on each leg of my journey....Bangalore to Paris, Paris to Atlanta, and Atlanta to St.Louis. So here are some of the sights I saw:


Since I was already tired out, and the journey from Bangalore began in the middle of the night, I didn't get any shots for quite a long time, but as we approached Paris, I got these...


Crossing the Alps:

My video monitor showed our plane approaching Gay Paree:

My favourite, of course, is this patchwork quilt of fields near Paris, with windmills all over:

When we left Paris, we crossed the chalk cliffs of Dover, mottled by the clouds and their shadows:

I enjoyed the demonstration of what the temperature was like, outside, with these ice fractals forming on the window:

We went around downtown Atlanta:

for my Facebook album.

Sorry, folks, I've not been to LJ at all (and I've been getting so much of spam comments that I don't feel like it, either)...but I'll keep myself au courant from now...my life is about to change very much, and I'm going to need a lot of courage for this.

Meanwhile, off, in a little more time, for my morning walk in Forest Park...it's already getting warmer and humid-er than I like....
