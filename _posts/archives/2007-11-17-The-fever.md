The fever
Drains the receiver ANd the giver
Of the germs;
The head is heavy,
Twice I've paid the physician's levy,
The body feels like food for worms.

The throat is hoarse,
And,what's worse,
Doesn't seem better by a jot;
It's been a week
Since I've felt like a freak
Combination of coughs... cold and hot.

No longer a human being
But a morbid entity, walking and seeing
If it can live another day...
It's just a fever...viral...
But it feels like doubtful survival...
I wish this FEVER would die and go awayyyyyyy!
