While D's mom was in St.Louis to help celebrate KTB's birthday picnic, we decided to walk around the Loop, and had dinner at

a Middle-Eastern cuisine place which seems to have very contradictory reviews (see the link above!)....

We enjoyed seeing the "Arab" tent dining area:

The hummus, the babaganoush, etc were quite tasty, and we had a fun dinner.

Both daughter and daughter's daughter are ill with CCC (Cold, Cough, Congestion) after the San Diego trip, so...it's been a busy couple of days so far! Will get around to posting the San Diego pics soon....
