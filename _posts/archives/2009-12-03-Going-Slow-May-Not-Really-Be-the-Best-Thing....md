On the way to visit the Jayamangali Blackbuck Sanctuary, we were negotating a badly dug-up stretch of highway, and I found this notice:


<a href="http://s967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/?action=view&current=IMG_8401.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/ae160/pedoral/IMG_8401.jpg" border="0" alt="pune go slow"></a>


Now, 


<a href="http://www.mapsofindia.com/distances/bangalore.html"> this link </a>

tells me that Pune is 835km (about 519 miles) from Bangalore....

I wonder if the guy who put up the notice HAD to give the way to Pune, but doesn't WANT us to go there....?
