Never make someone a priority in your life
When you are an option in their life.
Relationships work best when they are balanced.


When you keep saying you are busy,
Then you are never going to be free.
When you keep saying you never have time,
Then you will never have time.


So true. It is a mark of maturity to realize these things, rather than type them out!

I *hate* telling anyone, "I am too busy for you", but I have caught myself saying this once or twice lately. That means only that I am not organized enough. If I don't have time to call someone, or spend a little time with them, then, either I am no longer close to them, or I need to re-organize...
