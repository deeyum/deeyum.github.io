The living creatures we saw were quite varied. Though the safari organized by the Forest Department was a little disappointing for the children (who of course had their hearts set on a big cat sighting!) they did enjoy whatever they did see, and were quite curious to know things. 


In fact, even as Chandu and I waited for the children to come to the hired bus, we noticed a pair of 

INDIAN GREY HORNBILLS

one of which stayed on the tree long enough for me to get a quick shot:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5797-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_5797-1.jpg" border="0" alt="hornbl 121110 vs"></a>

and one of the first birds we were able to show the children when we arrived was the

WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER:

<lj-cut text="lots more if you click here">


Some of the other birds we saw included a sighting that was very thrilling for me...the endemic-to-the-Western Ghats

RUFOUS BABBLER


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6113-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6113-1.jpg" border="0" alt="rfs bblr 131110"></a>

and though it hid in the Lantana bushes, and wouldn't show itself later, I still got a nice video of its call:


<lj-embed id="542"/>

At several places, we saw the male

SCARLET MINIVET

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6429.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6429.jpg" border="0" alt="scrlet mnvt 131110"></a>


as well as the female, jumping around high up in the tree canopy:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6425.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6425.jpg" border="0" alt="minivet fml 131110"></a>


Another little jewel was the

SMALL BLUE KINGFISHER

that often was seen at various lakes, waiting patiently for a fish to come near the surface:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6420.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6420.jpg" border="0" alt="sbk 151110"></a>


We saw lots of 

GREATER FLAMEBACK WOODPECKERS

everywhere:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5916.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_5916.jpg" border="0" alt="minivet fml 121110"></a>


the children were delighted to see the

EURASIAN GOLDEN ORIOLE

at several places:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6143-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6143-1.jpg" border="0" alt="golden oriole 131110"></a>


I managed to get a video of its call, too:

<lj-embed id="543"/>

You can hear the children exclaiming in wonder!


I think that this is a 

SPANGLED DRONGO

though it's rather far away and against the light!

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6254.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6254.jpg" border="0" alt="spangled drongo"></a>


I got the call of this bird, too, though I am not sure which kind of Drongo it is:



<lj-embed id="544"/>


Coming back after the JLR safari on the motorbike, Jadeswamy and I looked up to see this truly magnificient

BLACK EAGLE

soaring overhead; I quickly aimed from the running bike, and got a foozly shot!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6333-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6333-1.jpg" border="0" alt="blk egle 141110"></a>


Everywhere, the

RUFOUS TREEPIE

also showed its beauty:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6286.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6286.jpg" border="0" alt="treepie"></a>


Some smaller creatures also delighted the children. Here's a

PILL BUG

going about its business:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6144-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6144-1.jpg" border="0" alt="pillbug 131110"></a>


a beautiful

LANTERN BUG:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6234.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6234.jpg" border="0" alt="lantern bug 131110"></a>

I was amazed, in the VGKK campus, to see dozens of 

EARTHWORMS

in a tree-trunk, moving in the water. What were they doing there? I don't know...


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6201.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6201.jpg" border="0" alt="earthworms in trunk 131110"></a>

of course, I got a short video of their wavy movement!


<lj-embed id="545"/>

These


NYMPHS

 on a leaf, looked so beautiful:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6026-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6026-1.jpg" border="0" alt="nymphs brt 121110"></a>


this CATERPILLAR slowly came sailing down on to the ground on a strand of silk, at ATREE:


So 
<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6382.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6382.jpg" border="0" alt="caterpillar"></a>

I also got this "river" or "highway" of ants, flowing along the rocks:

<lj-embed id="546"/>



I got several butterflies, including some when the trip was over and I was roaming around the Valley School campus, waiting for the school bus to take me home!

Here's the 

COMMON FOUR-RING:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6162.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6162.jpg" border="0" alt="cmn 4 ring 131110"></a>


the

COMMON PIERROT:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6502.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6502.jpg" border="0" alt="cmn pierrot 151110"></a>

the

COMMON CASTOR:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6497-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6497-1.jpg" border="0" alt="castor"></a>

the

BARONET (why was it named so, I wonder?)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6494.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6494.jpg" border="0" alt="baronet"></a>

the


YELLOW PANSY:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6493.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6493.jpg" border="0" alt="yellow pansy 151110"></a>


Though we were unable to see any elephants, or big cats, we certainly did see a lot of Langurs, and on the way back from the JLR safari, Jadeswamy showed me this

INDIAN POND TERRAPIN:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6332.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6332.jpg" border="0" alt="terrapin 141110"></a>

You can see the head of another one poking up through the water, on the right hand side.

Apart from the 

<a href=""> tiny frog </a>

that I posted about earlier,

amphibians included this lovely

TOAD:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5839-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_5839-1.jpg" border="0" alt="toad"></a>


Reptiles included this

CHECKERED KEELBACK

that we saw swimming in the pond near the Forest Dept office at K.Gudi:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6397.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6397.jpg" border="0" alt="keelback"></a>


A 

GARDEN LIZARD

sitting on a granite post:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5885.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_5885.jpg" border="0" alt="whole lizard"></a>

When it feels threatened, the lizard comes up with a defence mechanism that seems for all the world like a smile!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_5889.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_5889.jpg" border="0" alt="garden lizard mouth 121110"></a>

Here's a

HOUSE GECKO

that the children handled with aplomb:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6383.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6383.jpg" border="0" alt="gecko"></a>


Amongst the mammals we sighted, apart from the Stripe-necked Mongoose, were

CHITAL OR SPOTTED DEER:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6290.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6290.jpg" border="0" alt="chital 131110"></a>


The

BARKING DEER

were plentiful:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6305.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6305.jpg" border="0" alt="barking deer 141110"></a>


When there are plenty of deer in a forest, that's always a good sign, because it means there's plenty of food for the predators, too, who can thrive. The food chain is in place!

I took a running shot of this

WILD BOAR:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6316.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6316.jpg" border="0" alt="wild boar 141110"></a>

Some of the Forest Department people had rescued this

SAMBHAR FAWN

and the children went ga-ga over it!


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6410.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6410.jpg" border="0" alt="sambhar fawn"></a>

They might not have seen wild elephants, but the sight of the camp elephants, Shriram, Kanti, and Kavita, being given a thorough scrubbing in the pond, held them enthralled for quite a while.

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6393.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6393.jpg" border="0" alt="elephants"></a>

Here's Shriram, the magnificient tusker:


<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6386.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6386.jpg" border="0" alt="shriram"></a>

In fact, the children really seemed to empathize with animals they could touch; at the Soliga settlement, it was nice to see kids clustered around a (real) kid!

Here's a newborn pup, that we found at the Shivanasamudra Falls, that had the children oohing and aahing:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6452.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6452.jpg" border="0" alt="newborn pup svsmdra flls 151110"></a>

Jadeswamy showed me a great many trees, this time, and they are on my Picasa Web Album; but I loved seeing the lotuses in the pond:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6090.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6090.jpg" border="0" alt="lotus n leaf 131110"></a>

I showed the children how, from a seed left on a tree by a bird, an epiphyte could spring to life on a tree:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6074.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6074.jpg" border="0" alt="epiphyte 121110"></a>

We saw several varieties of mushroom:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_6503.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6503.jpg" border="0" alt="mushroom"></a>


But I didn't have <lj user="asakiyume"> to tell me if they were edible:

</lj-cut>

My last shot is of these unknown caterpillars, looking so beautiful on the underside of a leaf:
