A couple of trips to Forest Park got me these....this

RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD

sitting on a bush,

and singing its usual "treeeeee" song:

Another Value-For-Money bird in terms of colourful appearance is the 

WOOD DUCK:

The birthday picnic we had for KTB was inaugurated by this

DOWNY WOODPECKER

low down on a tree-trunk:

It didn't seem to be bothered by us at all:

Up and down he(or she) goes, looking for insects in the bark:

Andrea Kimberling suddenly found a caterpillar (not in her food, luckily, but only in her hair!)

And a little later, she came up with this green beauty:

After the picnic was over, we decided to let Mark show us the fledged 

GREAT HORNED OWL

babies; here's the first one we saw (we didn't get to see the third one)

The second owlet was not too far away:

But we decided to go home then, and leave the park "to darkness and to him" as Gray would say!

But the very next morning, on my walk, I spotted this

WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW

which I had never seen before..what a beauty it is!

With Mark, I hope to spot a coyote or a fox soon....!
