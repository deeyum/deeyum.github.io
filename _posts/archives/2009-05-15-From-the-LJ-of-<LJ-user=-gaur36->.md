What a pity that we squander our treasures and our good practices to the excitement of aping western ways...

Today I walked to the Farmers' Market in the Loop,

 and walked back with my purchases; the fact that I had 3 bags (one backpack and two carries) attracted a fair number of curious looks. I realized that no one is used to carrying groceries or vegetables/fruits and walking around. Walking is an activity engaged in only for exercise. It is NOT a form of locomotion unless one is too poor to afford anything but public transport...

When KM and I told people that we walk <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=s&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-bk-gm&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=google%20maps"> from home to the St Louis Galleria </a> (no.1 on the map), and back, we got a lot of "wow" reactions!,
