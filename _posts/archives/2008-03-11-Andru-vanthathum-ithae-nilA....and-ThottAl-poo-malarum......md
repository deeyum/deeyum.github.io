I googled for the video of this lovely song, and I must say, whenever I get to old Tamizh film hits, they are always short of something...no lyrics, or I have to shuffle through dozens of other songs, or get shunted into other people's conversations about them...

I got this YouTube video:

But notice, the embedding, which would have been so convenient,has been "disabled by request". What a user-unfriendly thing to do....

The "sad" version is here, at

The words...will have to physically listen and write down the words to the happy and sad versions...but meanwhile, <lj user="asakiyume">, this is the song that says, the same moon that appeared then is appearing now...!

Update: here are the words and a rough translation, for both the happy and sad versions:


Happy version:


anru vanthathum ithEy nilA
inru vanthathum ithEy nilA
enrum uLLathu orEy nilA
iruvar kaNNukkum orEy nilA


ambikApathi kaNda nilA
amarAvathiyai thinra nilA
kamban pAdiya veLLai nilA
kaviyil Adiya piLLai nilA  (2)..(anru)



kAthal Romeo kaNda nilA
kanni Juliet venra nilA
pAvai Laila pArtha nilA
pAlai vanatthin vaNNa nilA (2).... (anru)

nAdu thoRum vantha nilA
nAgareekam pArtha nilA
pArthu pArthu shalittha nilA
pAthi theinthathu veLLai nilA (2)  (anru)


nilA = moon

Ambikapathi and Amaravathi were legendary lovers (from the Andhra Pradesh region); Laila and Majnu, from north India; I don't have to introduce Romeo and Juliet...

Kamban was an ancient Tamizh author who wrote his version of the epic, the rAmAyaNA. He is generally cited as the epitome of literary creation. 



this same moon came then
this  same moon comes now
forever, there is only one moon
the same moon, for both of us to see


the moon that Ambikapathi saw 
the moon that ate at Amaravathi's heart
the moon that Kamban sang about
the child-moon (that is, the waxing moon) that danced in poetry

the moon that the lover Romeo saw
the moon that the maiden Juliet won over
the moon that the young woman Laila saw
the colourful moon of the desert

the moon that is all over the land
the moon that has seen civilization
the moon that has got tired of seeing it
the  white moon that has got erased to half


The sad version...


anru vanthathum ithEy nilA
inru vanthathum ithEy nilA
inbam thanthathum orEy nilA
Enga vaitthathum orEy  nilA... aaa....(2)

kAthal thanthathu vaNNa nilA
kaLangam illA kanni nilA
mEgham moodiya veLLi nila
veLLai uLLam koNda nilA...aaa (2)

pEsha sonnathu anbu nilA
piriya sonnathu thunba nilA
thoonga sonnathu kAthal nilA
thudikka vittathu kAla nilA...aaa (2)


this same moon came then
this same moon comes now
the same moon gave pleasure
the same moon made (us) yearn

the colourful moon gave us love
the maiden moon without blemish
the silver moon covered with clouds
the moon with a white soul


the moon of love asked us to speak
the moon of sorrow asked us to part
the moon of love told us to sleep
the moon of time left us to twitch in agony....


And if you want a lovely song with an "off-beat" beat, listen to this...I think Saroja Devi, a Kannadiga actress who ruled the Tamizh screen, is one of the most beautiful women I have seen (and no 18" anorexia waistline either!)


<lj-embed id="16" />


this is a haunting, sweet-happy-pensive song...one of my great favourites. <lj user="thaths">....if you are reading this..this is for you, too. However awful MGR looks, this song is fantastic.

Er, the subtitles are less than fantastic...in fact, they are downright hilarious...fruits orchard and flowers gang indeed! The very first line is badly translated; it says, " if we touch, flowers will bloom"...actually, that should be, "when touched, flowers bloom", to which the woman replies, "I bloomed without being touched".... But you get the general drift. And yes, it IS a song of love and sex. Saroja Devi illustrates how one can look sexy with traditional clothes on. And she also illustrates how our ideal of feminine beauty seems to have changed over the past decades....

Must have been so difficult,in those days (1963 I think) to synchronise the "off" beats in the soundtrack, with the clapping in the movie...but it's been done so well.
