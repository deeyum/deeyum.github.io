Driving down the highway from Bangalore to Chennai gives a great opportunity to see a lot of different kinds of architecture....some very, very old, as in the ruined fort at Vellore:

There are the shrines that cling precariously to the edge of cliffs:

Colour is not an understated affair with new buildings, look at this bright blue one that is so "attached" to its neighbour....

The ornate facade of this one is smile-inspiring, too:

The  bridges over the pAlAr (that means, "river of milk"...we'd be lucky to find some pools of water in it now, we have to call it "maNalAr" or river of sand!) are also impressive....

Of course I also posted about the 

<a href=""> Australian architecture </a>

that I saw on the way....

but even the architecture of the loads on passing vans is amazing, sometimes, look at the way the plantain leaves (used for  serving meals in weddings, and even in homes, and as packing material for food) have been packed into the back of this vehicle!

The architecture of the 

<a href="http://wikimapia.org/102784/Rajiv-Gandhi-Memorial"> Rajiv Gandhi memorial </a>


 is also interesting, 

and the Tiranga (tricolour) stands sentinel to this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Rajiv_Gandhi"> fallen leader of India </a>

cut down in his prime by a suicide bomber....
