I usually don't do memes, but I actually asked <LJ user="prashanthchengi"> for one, and here goes, a letter of the alphabet, with which I must list 5 favourites....

1. Cream. I just love the top-of-the-milk, whipped cream...write "cream" on a piece of paper and I'll eat that! 

2. Carbon. I am fascinated by two of its forms...coal, and diamond, their essential oneness in spite of the incredible difference in their appearance...it's a great metaphor for me.

3. Chemistry. Though I am not one for equations, the process of interaction of chemicals...and the way, at some point, they give rise to life...is wonderful. 

4. Creatures. I enjoy watching all sorts of creatures...from a tusker to a tarantula. The world of living beings is full of marvels.

5. Cryptic Crosswords. I am hopelessly addicted to them.


C...PC....I've done the MM...sorry, the meme.
