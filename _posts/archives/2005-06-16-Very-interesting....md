Funny thing...I go through so many LJs....it is like being surrounded by an articulate, multi-faceted group of people...I find it so fascinating that I keep forgetting to update my own LJ!

In the same way, one of my favourite parts of a newspaper or magazine is the readers' letters section. Basically I enjoy hearing what people want to say...and the diversity of opinions on different issues. People are really interesting.
