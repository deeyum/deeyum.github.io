We were lucky to sight a huge variety of creatures at Kabini...one of the most stunning being the

SOUTHERN BIRDWING

the largest butterfly in India....

Here's the beauty, at work amongst the flowers of the Morning Glory:

A

MALABAR RAVEN

did not pose, I had to keep running behind it and track it down!

Shreeram and I were lucky to see this

BLUE MORMON

at rest:

Later, all of us saw several

GRASS YELLOWS

mating:

For a little while, we watched this

SPIDER WASP

hard at work, beginning to make her nest in the ground, where she would later bring prey that she would stun and lay her eggs on, as I have

<a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/693170.html"> documented here </a>

And here's one example of what could be prey at one time, and predator (right now, deep  in that hole in the  tree trunk, it is sitting on several slugs which, presumably, it's going to be feeding on)....the

YELLOW-THIGHED TARANTULA:

Mammals included the lovely, lithe

BLACK-FOOTED LANGUR:

and

WILD BOAR:

some beautiful, orange

MUSHROOMS

caught our eye on safari:

For most of the time I was there, I could see only half a 


LEOPARD:

But the TIGER that was saw, though clearly visible in the undergrowth, could not be photographed because of very low light...though Shreeram took a shot on his Canon 7D at ISO 6400....that my old 20D can never achieve!



It was lovely to see the 

SILK COTTON

bursting out of the pods of the Bombax trees:

This 

AMORPHOPHYLLUS YAM fruiting body 

provided a burst of colour:

What a marvellous variety of things there are to see, in the wild!
