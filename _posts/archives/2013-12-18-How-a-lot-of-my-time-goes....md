List of things/services broken, or locked, or stopped, when I returned after a 9-month absence: 

Bank account, cooking gas connection, UPS (back-up power system in the flat), washing machine, air-conditioner (which I hardly ever used) bathroom taps, sewing machine, mobile phone, cable TV....

Thankfully, since I was paying around Rs.1000 a month, my landline and internet connection were still working. Big relief!

Since I refused to stop my travel plans, the "fixing" process still continues. Down to the sewing machine. (Not going to fix the cooking gas until I need a new cylinder,because I will then again be on the 180-day countdown;nor the air-conditioner until I feel I really need it)

 Maintaining an establishment in absentia in India is....tough.
