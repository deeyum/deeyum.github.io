By very popular demand, here's a picture of a sight that brings a fatuous smile to KM's face:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9190033@N03/683297699/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/683297699_528c303eb6_o.jpg" width="479" height="284" alt="Honda CR-V" /></a>

I am ambivalent about this car,which is a HUGE gas-guzzler but apparently has far less emissions than other cars in the same class. And..th car IS a dream to drive, so I am generally torn between not wanting to to take the Honda CR-V out, and then wanting to drive, too...very inconsistent.

I compromise by cycling and walking wherever I can, and enjoying the drive when we DO take the CR-V out.
