I went to meet the participants in the latest Naturalist Training Program (NTP) at JLR Bannerghatta. 

As I was returning to the bus terminus in the JLR vehicle, I noticed this mongoose on a side lane in the Herbivore Safari area.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22662849760/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0345"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5820/22662849760_bf1c95b4c0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0345"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was very still, and suddenly, Radha, who was with me, said, "It's looking at a snake!" And so it was...

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22662854370/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0347"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/676/22662854370_26e3357b4a_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0347"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However, even as we watched, the mongoose suddenly decided that it didn't want a confrontation.
The two parted ways..amicably!

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22862010081/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0348"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5753/22862010081_a1a88f01d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0348"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The rat snake then emerged on to the road.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22824866686/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0349"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/753/22824866686_1c639569db_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0349"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 I felt that the very size of it, observed by the alert mongoose, might have given it pause and resulted in the decision of "ahimsa"!

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22229726403/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0351"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/750/22229726403_eb64305551_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0351"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unmolested, the snake crossed the path and went on its way.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/22228129234/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0352"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5826/22228129234_91e377114b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="IMG_0352"></a><script async="async" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A thrilling almost-drama that was a drama in itself! Truly, nature and wildlife spring surprises.
