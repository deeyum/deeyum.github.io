This one is in my own apartment building. This description is supposed to *encourage* people to start playing chess (after picking up the pawns from the security guards; why they have them is beyond me), not scare them off...

There was also a delightful notice next to a high bar that had been put up, for children to do stretching exercises; that one said, "For those who wants to grow their heights." But alas, they have decided that our children are tall enough..both bar and notice have disappeared....


If any of you want to see other delightful notices like these..go to <LJ user="jace">'s moblog!
