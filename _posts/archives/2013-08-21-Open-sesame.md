Suddenly, I was able to see, and comment, on friends' posts. And ofkose, it's closed up again..but I peeked into several lives, and minds, and my dear, dear friends, it's good to know you are all doing those interesting things! 

I'm sure that most people would have given up posting on LJ by now if they had my trouble, but I am doggedly keeping up, because it's the place that's given me so many good friends....

Dear friends...I do read your posts whenever I can. I try to make quick comments, so that I can go to more friends' posts before the opening closes up...
