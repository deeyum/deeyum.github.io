A *huge* rally in Mumbai ensured that we could not make our second visit of the day, and had to take a taxi to the railway station that was earlier called "Victoria Terminus", with 3 hours to spare for our train to Nagpur.

The station building is so exquisitely beautiful...pics will follow. (Right now, a Reliance card means a very slow connection.)

A/c passengers are given a LARGE airconditioned waiting room on the first floor, with comfortable couches, clean toilets, a bathroom with a working geyser, a flat-screen TV, and plenty of plugpoints too.

I am VERY impressed.

Off now to catch the train..now I know why it is called LUG-gage....sigh!
