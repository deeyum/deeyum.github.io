She looks at me through my son-in-law's eyes
Under my daughter's eyebrows.
She's got her great-grandmother's rosebud mouth
Under her maternal grandfather's nose.

Her impish mischief feminds me of the tales
Of her father's younger brother.
Her grimly determined attempts to walk
Bring back to me...her mother.

I do hope that this mixture-of-people girl
Improves and doesn't worsen...
It's a miracle that such a conglomerate
Of genes...is a unique person!
