With thanks to <LJ user="usha123">...I have never been to the North East...too little time to do all the travelling I want! First, I thought the world was vast, then I thought India was a universe by itself...now this is the way I feel about Karnataka! I have been fortunate to be able to travel all over the world, both to touristy places as well as little-known countries like Leichstenstein...but there's so much more to see out there!
