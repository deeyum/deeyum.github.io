I had already posted the pics of the Hawk Moth caterpillar (cognoscenti should call them "cats", you know, but we ignoramuses still refer to the whole name!) when I realized that there were quite a LOT of "non-bird" pics that I wanted to post, and not wanting to burden my poor readers with a perfect avalanche of pictures, decided to do a separate post.

Given my level of knowledge about the insect kingdom, four letters are going to appear very often....they are  U, N, I , and D! So let me start with an UN-ID, but exceedingly colourful bug that I found on a plant in one of the ditches which are, to budding naturalists, real treasures!

And a  GRASSHOPPER (well, it looks pretty and painted to me but Karthik says it is NOT a painted grasshopper!)

<lj-cut text="for more pictures...here you go"> 





Here is the nest-complex of the SOCIAL SPIDER, one of which can be seen nearby:

Here's the web of the SIGNATURE SPIDER (Priya spotted this near our table in the restaurant when we were having brunch!)...the spider weaves a kind of "X" before beginning with the rest of the web (you can see one part of it on the lower left-hand-side)...hence the name...

Here's another of those "four-letter" bug (un-id!) on the trunk of the Pongameia tree (the tree which is supposed to give us biodiesel!)...look at the excellent camouflage...

Update: this is a PREYING MANTIS, id from Karthik, thank you!


I took this shot of the shooter...here's Karthik focussing on a spider:

Here's the  spider  that Karthik was "getting close" to:

And while he was taking that, we also found this LYNX SPIDER:


<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14175484@N04/1576436318/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2045/1576436318_77d887e89d_o.jpg" width="361" height="444" alt="un id spider 141007" /></a>

Looking at the shape of its body, KM christened it the "bhutta" (corn-on-the-cob) spider!


Here's another spider which I haven't asked Karthik about yet...update, Karthik says this, too, is a LYNX SPIDER:

(see? I simply titled it "another spider"...simple, until Karthik helps out!)


A DRAGONFLY, no doubt an expert will tell us exactly what it is...

And I got this LEMON PANSY by dint of careful stalking...

some BUG NYMPHS..which ones ? Who knows? they looked so pretty, I just clicked:

I am sure, though, that someone will give me an id to this butterfly..Update, thanks Karthik! It is a DANAID EGGFLY...

And last AND least, here's the totally un-id creature who went all around, not worrying too much about id, genus, species or families, but just enjoying what could be seen...
