The photographs of the Uttaranchal trip that I will be posting are all taken by my husband...

He and I make a very funny team. He can't spot the birds and I can't take the photos...so we need each other! All the other guests were greatly entertained by the sight of us in Uttaranchal, shrieking (in suppressed voices of course, for fear of scaring the birds) "Look at that!"(me); "Wait! Let me get there!" (him); "Did you get that?" (me); "The #$^* bird flew away!" (him)...and scrambling from place to place!
