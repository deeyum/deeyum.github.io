Something I'd like to share with all of you is this wonderful video by a couple who are good friends, Raghunath Belur and Sugandhi Gadadhar. The audio for this is a percussion "conversation" between two  Indian musical instruments that often form a part of a classical Carnatic music concert. Apart from the great visuals, they have very creatively incorporated this percussion passage, which, in my language (Tamizh) we call a "thani Avarthanam". After the flute,you hear the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mridangam"> MRIDANGAM </a>, a south Indian classical music percussion instrument

alternating with the

<a href=""> TABLA </a>, a north Indian pair of drums used in all forms of music.

They alternate to a diminuendo and then join in and build to  a crescendo, after which the flute picks up the melody again and brings the thani Avarthanam to a conclusion that the creatures dance to!

It's 3'14" long.

Ganeshgudi, in Karnataka, lies in the Western Ghats, with is a World Biodiversity hotspot, and all these birds can be seen in just a day or two.
