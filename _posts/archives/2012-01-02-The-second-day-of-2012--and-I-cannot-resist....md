Had a lovely day yesterday, wandering around the Bannerghatta zoo area..and was going to post about it, but I received two delightful photos that made me change my mind.....KTB apparently like "kating" a lot, and here she is with her dad.

First they sit...

Then they stand....

Then (hopefully) off they went, hand in hand!

Now back to my bird pictures, with a smile in my heart...and on my face....my darling Boodi Ma, "kating" around happily!
