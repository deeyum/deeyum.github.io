is the Wiki entry for the

BLACK IBIS:

"The Red-naped Ibis (Pseudibis papillosa) also known as the Indian Black Ibis or just the Black Ibis, is a species of ibis found in parts of the Indian Subcontinent. The sexes are alike. It has a curlew-like long down-curved bill, a black head with a patch of crimson, and a white patch near the shoulder. This largish black bird is found at lakes, in marshes, in riverbeds and on irrigated farmlandâ€”it is not as aquatic as many other species of ibis. It is gregarious and generally forages on margins of wetlands in small numbers. It is a common breeding resident in Haryana. It nests in trees and breeds from March to October in North India."

I was very fortunate, indeed, to stay with a friend who as a 5-acre plot of land in Ahmedabad; part of her undeveloped property is maintained as a lawn, part of it is a wilderness, and part of it is given over to growing wheat and vegetables. I had a lovely view from my bedroom window, and was lucky enough to watch these beautiful birds....they were sitting on the neighbouring buildings:

Grazing on the lawn:

Resting, relaxed and unthreatened, with one leg up:

and in particular, one mother and child, on the vegetable patch.

Here's the Ibis chick, obviously calling, "Mama!Mama!"....

The chick is  importuning its mother:

It is running behind the mother:

And, finally, the mother feeds it:

I got this video of the child running around behind the mother and harassing her for food:

Children are always demanding attention, whether
Or not, they happen to have skin...or feathers!
