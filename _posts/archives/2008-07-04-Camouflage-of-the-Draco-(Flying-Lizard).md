It's my turn to post another "where is it" picture....this one's much easier (and of course, a far fouler photograph!) than <LJ user="kalyan">'s though! Here's the Draco or the Flying Lizard in the Salim Ali bird sanctuary in Thattekad, Kerala:

Here it is, after it's scuttled a bit around the tree-trunk, just look at the beauty of its neck-fan:

And a view of another lizard, the following morning:
