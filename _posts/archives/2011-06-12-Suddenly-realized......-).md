of Switzerland had emailed me on 

<a href="http://www.indianaturewatch.net/"> INW </a>

last year, and asked if he could use my images and videos of the 

<a href=""> Yellow-thighed Tarantula </a>

that I took in Kabini. 

I said, yes, of course, and forgot all about it, and just now when I went to the INW inbox for some other message (someone is asking if he can use my image of the 


ELLIOTT'S SHIELDTAIL
