The birds we spotted in Kabini, on the way there, and on the way back, were numerous...

On the way out, we started with the beautiful sub-adult 

HOUSE SPARROW

<lj-cut text="going on to other birds...">


nearby was the female:

On safari, we saw many

MALABAR PARAKEETS

...if you look closely, you can see the raindrops on this one!

Photography was dificult because of the low light and the rain. If I had high standards like my fellow-photographs, all these photographs would have gone to the Recycle Bin, but me...I post here my SMS of the beautiful group of

SMALL GREEN BEE-EATERS

we found huddling together!

We also saw this 

COMMON MYNAH

which, through some mutation, was entirely bald...

It seemed to be thriving fine, though I dubbed it the Egyptian Vulture Mynah!

We went hunting for Blue-tailed Bee-eaters...the hunt was unsuccessful, but we did find this little blue jewel, the

SMALL BLUE KINGFISHER:

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_7837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_7837.jpg" border="0" alt="small blue kingfisher 200710"></a>

However, we did wonder if it was a genetic mutation or some form of pollution which was responsible for this....

A lifer for me was this 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Cuckooshrike">LARGE CUCKOO SHRIKE </a>

(thanks for the id, Shreeram!)

...it was nice to two birds posing together.... here are the

WHITE-BELLIED DRONGO 

and the

SCARLET MINIVET

...two birds in the camera ARE two birds in the bush, or on the branch!

Another Drongo was the spectacular-looking

RACKET-TAILED DRONGO, 

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_6536.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6536.jpg" border="0" alt="racket-tailed drongo 210710"></a>

with its musical-note tail!


An

IMPERIAL GREEN PIGEON

sat in the mist and rain:

Sometimes,

STREAK-THROATED WOODPECKERS

are not all that common to see, but we saw quite a few....

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_6626.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6626.jpg" border="0" alt="common flameback kabini 210710"></a>

here's another one:

Another woodpecker we spotted was this

YELLOW-FRONTED (or MAHRATTA) WOODPECKER:

We saw a few

CHESTNUT-HEADED BEE-EATERS

(I'm sure none of the others would consider this a shot worth posting, but I do!)

<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_6811.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6811.jpg" border="0" alt="chestnut tailed bee-eater 210710 kabini"></a>

A picture of happy romance was this 

SPOTTED DOVE

couple:

The raptors didn't disappoint, either. Through both days, we sighted a total of 12 

CRESTED SERPENT EAGLES

...here's a juvenile (no doubt, a teenager that has been grounded by the parents for bad behaviour, that's why it looks like that on the tree!)



<a href="http://s835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/?action=view&current=IMG_6681.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i835.photobucket.com/albums/zz275/dffrntpx/IMG_6681.jpg" border="0" alt="juv crested serpent eagle 210710"></a>

here's an adult...

The 

CRESTED (or CHANGEABLE) HAWK EAGLE 

also gave us a good sighting!

There were plenty of

PEAFOWL

in the forests, and here are a few:

</lj-cut>

The peacock being the national bird of India, is a colourful bird to close with!
