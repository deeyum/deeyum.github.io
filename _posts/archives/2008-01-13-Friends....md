The greatest of treasures in this world are friends....

Was feeling lower than the underside of a cockroach, and lots of friends came by and I feel much more cheerful.

But it's also difficult to concentrate and pack when friends are thronging around, and I worry that I will leave something essential behind. I swear by a well-thought-out list...unless I am unable to locate the *&^$ list.

But the packing's  getting done.

Sleep and I ...sworn enemies.
