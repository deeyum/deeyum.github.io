How does everyone keep walking shoes clean? Keeping them a pristine white is SO difficult in this land of dust and dirt. (They never seem to get this light shade of brown abroad.)

I had found that putting them through the shortest cycle on my washing machine worked...but this time I have come back with so much of the Desh ki Dharti (soil of the nation) sticking to them that even after this process, they are still not WHITE.

So if anyone has any tips...pass them on please. Otherwise my next pair will be black. (Actually, I did get a pair of black sneakers, saved them for months to wear NEW on my US trip...and found that the shop had given me one size too small...it was given to someone else there.)
