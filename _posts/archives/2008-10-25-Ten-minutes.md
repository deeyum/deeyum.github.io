It's rare to find....
Ten minutes in the middle of a busy day.
But just now...it's happened.
Most of my chores are done;
The last bit of lunch can be started 
After a little while...
There is a sense of peace,
Things done, being on top
Instead of the usual scramble to keep up.
It's peaceful in this room;
The weather's lovely, cool and cloudy,
And I feel serene.
Happiness consists of...
Ten minutes like this, in little pieces, here and there,
I hope...I always find these ten minutes of peace each day.
