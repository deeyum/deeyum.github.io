1. Meryl Streep,as always, is a good actress. 1(b)...it takes me forever to finally get to see a movie.

2. There are (at least) 3 levels of dressing in the US....level A, "Walmart clothes" as it is referred to in the movie. Level B, good sensible yet definitely-a-cut-better working clothes, the type that Andrea wears much later in the movie. Level C, "designer" stuff..that marks a woman (much more likely to be a starving girl though) off completely as belonging to the fashionistas.

Me? Sub-Walmart! My daughter took mealong so that I could buy myself a coat, which she said, had an excellent cut, made me look slim and ...er..."sexy" (dunno what that means, nowadays, when everything from tyres to theatre seats are "sexy")...and it just didn't keep out the coold. The next day, I found a coat which made me look like an Eskimo..but a warm and comfortable one...no shape, but nice and toasty. Guess which one we just went and returned, the tags intact...I look at the fashionista stick-maidens that strut across leggily  in their tiny little coats and skirts and wonder, don't they ever feel the cold?
