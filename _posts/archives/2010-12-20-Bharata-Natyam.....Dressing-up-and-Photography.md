Our niece is getting her brochure done, for her aragEtram (maiden public performance) next year at Florida. Someone came to do her makeup and after she was dressed, a portfolio of photographs was made at a studio in Basavanagudi.

Here she is, before the start of the process:

And here she is with the make up on:

We took her to the studio in Dr D V Gundappa Road, in Basavanagudi:

Here she is, striking a pose:

It was very enjoyable for me, but all of the family were totally jet-lagged and tired!
