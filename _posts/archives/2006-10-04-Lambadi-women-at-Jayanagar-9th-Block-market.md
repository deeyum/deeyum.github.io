These are not "costumes" but the actual clothes that these women wear every day...so colourful and beautiful! Look at their jewellery (including the multiple armbands on one of them &nbsp;and the waist decoration on&nbsp;another) &nbsp;, and the "joothi"s that one woman is wearing.

The vegetables&nbsp;are: top row, a variety of beans that I have seen only in India. we call it Avaraikkai, plantain tree stems (they are delicious!), cabbages; middle row: &nbsp;tomatoes, another variety of &nbsp;beans,&nbsp; and you can see some cucumbers between the women's heads; lower row: okra and brinjal (eggplant or aubergine), and radishes in the red container on the ground.
