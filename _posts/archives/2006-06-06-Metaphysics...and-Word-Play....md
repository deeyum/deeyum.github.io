As I sat on my new chair,
I *knew* the cushion wasn't there,
Nor seat, nor arms, nor legs, nor back...
But I sat,ignoring things like that.


Here lies John Bunn,
He was killed by a gun.
His name wasn't Bunn, but Wood,
But Wood wouldn't rhyme with gun,
But Bunn would.

The first was inspired by a serial conversation I have been having with <LJ user="nearfar">...
