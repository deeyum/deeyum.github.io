A sad cloud forms over my brain...I didn't call my brother too often; he was as taciturn over the phone as he would be witty and mordant off it. But once in a while, I would call and we would exchange some cursory chitchat. And I miss that...

I try to cheer myself up with old memories, and the echo of his laughter in his very happy, sunny childhood does the trick.

Laughter IS the best medicine.

They'll make your hair stand on end without any horror movie....
