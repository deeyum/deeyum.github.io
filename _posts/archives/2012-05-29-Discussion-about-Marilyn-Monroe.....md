One member of a mailing list I belong to started by showing a statue of Marilyn Monroe in the famous "billowing-up skirt" pose on a ventilation grating, being put up in Chicago. What was interesting to me about the photograph was that the head of MM was completely covered...but obviously, the men on the list took off in a different (northward) direction.

Weather Conditions - Palm Springs, CA

In the desert town of Palm Springs, California
Where Marilyn moved in just two days ago
The temperatures are hot but not unduly hot
Just about ninety degrees Fahrenheit hot
And the winds are very light
Close to zero miles per hour - with breezes from the Southeast
The tourists gawking at Marilyn
Are no doubt finding the air hotter -  much hotter
And asking - I am only guessing -
"Just how windy does it ever get over here? Oh, just asking!"

He then added:

Her Timeless Marilynness

Her yellow gold hair
Her parted ruby lips
Her sultriness seductive

Her sun ripened womanhood
Her billowing skirt
Her simulated modesty

Her innocence disarming
Her come hither allure
Her husky crooning voice

Her sad sad smile
Her rudely shortened life
Her timeless Marilynness

******************************

To this, B replied:

To the actual content, however, it's not the wind that did the deed.  The classic Marilyn picture was her dress blowing up because of the gusts that usually emanate from such a subway vent.

See http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/2007/06/marilyn_monroes.html. 

You will notice that the statue also has such a grate or vent under it.

*********************************

To this, V's response was:

OK, that means I need to correct myself. How about this?

A Star on a Subway Vent

On the subway vent where Marilyn stood
Let us place a star, New Yorkers!
As they did in Rodeo Drive
As they are doing, no doubt
On some puffy, floating silver cloud above

**********************

After a little to-and-fro, he added:
 
I'd be surprised, though, if we don't have a Subway Sandwich franchise or two in Ahmedabad.

*********************

At this point, M, one of the 3 ladies in the egroup, replied:

My son survives on subway sandwiches in Ahmedabad these days...he is working there.

PS please do continue with this banter.....we love it :-)

****************************

B's response:

Okay, in that case: No subway grates, but great Subways.

Who needs Marilyns when we have Kokilabens and Shardabens?
Not that any sari clad Kokilaben or Shardaben would ever step on a subway grate, even if we had a subway ;-)

I somehow doubt that the impact would not be the same if they did. No gold stars, no statues to honor Kokiben or Shardaben, no Vasus writing poetry after the event.

My final response was:

On this egroup  there are thoughts profound
Which gather not a peep or sound.
But let the topic be M., Marilyn...
Then watch everyone joining in!
Well,if I, too, had legs that great,
I''d be stepping over *every* ventilation grate.
But M, M, and U (in my rhyming verse)
Are not in the running for Ms.Universe.
Their brains and their versatile talents
Are what matters in the end, you gents!
And the rest of us spouses married you guys
Because we thought you lot are smart and wise.
So...the only use for ventilation
Is, pure and simple...titillation.
We don't need these "updraft" wiles
To keep our men all wreathed in smiles.
Our waists may have more circumference,
But we make up for that in common sense....

These mailing lists are "grate" fun sometimes!
