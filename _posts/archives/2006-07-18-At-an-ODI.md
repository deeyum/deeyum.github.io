We had been to the One Day International between India and Pakistan at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. That's Aniruddh Hari, who entered our lives as a 4 month-old and helped me get over my ENS (empty nest syndrome). He set the trend of calling us (he is 50 years younger than my spouse!) by our names which many of the children in our apartment building follow to this day! He has every statistic to do with cars and cricket at his fingertips...he has grown into an independent young guy now, but is SO special to us...

When we go to a cricket match we are...er...cheeky patriots..
