Hats off to Bangalore and the development authority (whatever is its current abbreviation). I have just witnessed the most amazing engineering feat ever achieved after the opening of the Jayadeva flyover. Its just unbelieveable, unimaginable, uncomprehendible, un.... (i'm lost for words). No other flyover in the world could ever have such a distinction. Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes.

This must well be the *first* flyover in the *world* which has caused more traffic congestion after completion and opening than *during* the construction phase.

Can any other flyover match this, I ask?

1) coz now traffic that has to go to 3 directions (BTM to Bannerghatta, BTM to Jayanagar, BTM&nbsp; to Dairy Circle) meet at half the original road (narrower due to flyover).
2) dumb shits have blocked all divider openings along Bannerghatta road. So any traffic that would have branched away at any of 3 turnings on the road now have to go till JD mara and u-turn back.
3) Traffic that used to go thru various routes inside and outside BTM, KEB Layout,&nbsp;9th Block etc etc... (without interrupting each others flow) now have come together to use the "grid separator". So result = more traffic than the road can handle.

need any more reasons? &gt;:

And I added the following points:

Good analysis Prashanth...I have a grandstand view, so I can add&nbsp; at least two more &nbsp;reasons for this chaos: 1) a place just before the flyover, on the J&nbsp;P Nagar side of the road, where buses have to stop in the middle of the two left lanes, and people have to get off in the middle of the traffic, creating blocks each and every time; &nbsp;and also, 2) two-wheeler riders going towards the flyover ,&nbsp;&nbsp;shifting the road-separator "fences" at about the same spot, &nbsp;to take an illegal right to BTM layout, cutting across traffic flowing from the flyover and asking for accidents to happen. Yesterday, even cars were trying to do this, nosing into the heavy stream of traffic.

The trees on the stretch separating the service road from the erstwhile Bannerghatta Road have all been cut down, but the space has not been used for anything, and the road narrows down immediately after the flyover. And this part of the road, leading from the flyover towards Bannerghatta, is half the width of the other side, and that's what takes the heavy evening traffic.

Have been watching the traffic each evening..and been profoundly thankful I don't have to be in it.

For THIS we suffered for three and a half years? DUMB flyover designers...

Who will read a housewife's blog and see if anything can be done? None of the traffic police or the BDA, that's for sure.
