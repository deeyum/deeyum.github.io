We were invited to someone's home to sit and watch the India-Pakistan twenty-twenty cricket match, and it was as enjoyable as the earlier one...it was a real humdinger and we won in the final over. But even if Pakistan had won, I would not have felt bad, the gritty way in which they fought back was  very impressive indeed. Truly a good match to watch, no matter who won. 

Drove back through rather rowdy scenes of celebration, though, and since KM was fast asleep, I was a little nervous about driving through the crowds of youngsters...but all was well.

I think T20 cricket is here to stay...shall we, in the future, watch ten-ten, five-five and finally, one-over matches? Best of 3 balls? ;-)
