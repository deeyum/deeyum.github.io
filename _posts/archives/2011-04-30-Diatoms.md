Though the bird count at the Bannerghatta Zoo area was on the low side today (this seemed to be more of an "audio"  than a "visual" day, with many more birds being heard than seen!)...we did see a lot of interesting stuff as usual. Here's one:


<a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/?action=view&amp;current=DSCF7902.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n602/Deepapctrsglr/DSCF7902.jpg" border="0" alt="diatom bgz 300411"></a>



Isn't that really beautiful...and doesn't it look like the prismatic effect of an oil slick on the puddle? Well...it does, and though it IS an oil slick in a way, it's far more complex than that.

Diatoms

(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom"> click  here the Wiki link about them </a>



are a type of phytoplankton, which originated during the Jurassic period. Now, they ooze out on to the rock, and the debris forms a  slick upon the water...and that's what I've photopgraphed.

Remember, the sheet rock in and around Bangalore (Peninsular Gneiss) is among the oldest exposed sheet rock in the world, at about 3 billion years....so we were standing on the ancient past, and looking at the light reflecting on something from the Jurassic period...enough to overwhelm  anyone into wonder, awe...and silence!
