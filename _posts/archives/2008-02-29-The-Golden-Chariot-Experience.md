I was *going* to blog in detail about my experiences on this heritage train but then I found that <LJ user="anitab"> has done a much better job of it at

I suggest you start at the last page (Page 7) and work your way back to Page 1...that's the right chronology of events. That's the way  you have to do it on Flickr!

First question, am I taking up the job? Don't know yet...depends on several parameters.
