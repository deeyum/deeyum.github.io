Apart from the birds...there was a lot to the Bird Race Day....one of the most striking was my view of the rock patterns at Ramnagara:

<lj-cut text="plenty of other sights here"> 

As we birded at Uttarahalli (meaning, literally, "northern village"), we saw this SIGNATURE SPIDER in the fields:

The crop itself was something I could not identify, and its flowers were beautiful!

Near Manchinabele, I found plenty of these pyramidal shrines. At first I thought they were decorated termite mounds, but they were not. I am told that such pyramidal shrines occur only in that area...I wonder what their significance is? There are always two together:

The scenery was awesome at Manchinabele:

And in a small bit of pond, I found this small, beautiful water lily:

At Manchinabele, the BULBS met up with us and we found that our tallies were the same!

Also in one field, I found these flags and could not understand what they denoted:

At Manchinabele village, we stopped to fill up our water bottles, and next to the car we found this BRINJAL (eggplant) plant:

We had lunch at this restaurant:

And very nice it was, too, to five hungry souls!

We rinally finished off at the Valley School and as the sun set, we decided to go back:

Almost the last image I got as we left the Valley School was this against-the-light image of a GARDEN LIZARD on the growth on one of the trees:

There are just a few images that I carried away in my camera...the ones I carry in my heart are even more wonderful!
