We visited a few homes for the golu, and I was most impressed by the collection of dolls the ladies seem to have acquired over the years:

I loved this representation of of the Carnatic Music Trinity, Saint Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshithar, and Shyama Sastri, with Raghavendra swami at the right:

Even male children sat and sang for Amman:

(That's Siddharth Rajagopal, and he sang very well!)

Of course, the food was an awesome spread in each household:

We're enjoying it all:

Some of us try out others' playthings:

The centerpiece in this golu was a "crawling Krishna" which was pinched by the baby of the house, and used to hit the passage walls :)

Here's the hostess, holding the baby who's holding the Krishna. Her elder daughter, Neha, is singing:

I loved seeing this Tanzania diorama, with the jungle, the wildlife, and Mt. Kilimanjaro!

Some of us were grappling with the wildlife, too:

Ofkose, the dressing-up must be documented!

And here's the dusk, deepening into the "ratri" (night) of the Navaratri!

We thoroughly enjoyed the golu visits, and ate our way through a lot of food :D
