I went to attend a wildlife photography workshop by Rathika Ramaswamy, for Pixetra...but that's not what this post is about. As I walked to the venue, I saw this old house...

I mused on when the house was built, how proud the owner (Mr Vaz) must have been to see this bungalow coming up in the beautiful city of Bangalore....here, you can see his name in the gate-post, and the name of the present owner...

One can say, "It Vas a wonderful house!"

Today, the house is taken over by weeds, and in the grip of Strangler Figs:

The old order changeth, yielding place to new....I wonder what has kept this house from disappearing, too, with a multi-storied glass-and-chrome building taking its place...litigation, is the most likely answer.

A little torn page out of Bangalore's history; no doubt, it will soon flutter into oblivion.
