Going with 23 children from the

<a href="http://www.thevalleyschool.info/">Valley School </a>

(yes, the same place where I go birding so often!) to 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biligiriranga_Hills"> Biligiri Rangana Hills </a>

because 

<a href="http://www.atree.org/"> ATREE </a>

has organized an outing for them, and I will be taking the children on a nature trail on Saturday, and on a safari (with a local guide) on Sunday evening. I hope to be able to visit, and possibly stay, at 

<a href="http://gorukana.org/"> Gorukana </a>

 the resort run by 

<a href="http://www.thebetterindia.com/326/vivekananda-girijana-kalyana-kendra-vgkk/"> VGKK </a>

and which is now mired in 

<a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/content/102689/samithi-alleges-vgkk-violating-forest.html"> controversy </a>.

Will be happy to take a look for myself! I'm back by Monday evening...and I suppose, the minute my back is turned (I will be away from the net) , all my LJ friends will rush to make the most interesting posts imaginable!
