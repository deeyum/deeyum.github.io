Where the trains went to and fro busily:

 where the amount of lumber being transported on one train was awe-inspiring:

PC (<lj user="prashanthchengi"> Prashanth Chengi) was getting ready to click, too!

This sculpture looked as if Casper the Friendly Ghost and his friends were having a picnic there:

Here;s PC with the station in the background:

I clicked this 

EURASIAN TREE SPARROW:

EURASIAN BLACKBIRD:

But that was when the (European, not Eurasian!) buildings caught my eye:

The same place, later in the dusk:

Some smaller touches were lovely, too:

What does this design mean?

I don't know the story behind this statue:

I wish telephone manhole covers were always this interesting!

Sometimes, the best fashion is no fashion at all:

Magnet Madrass? :D

this funeral parlor was right next to the Income Tax office!

I agree, bingo can be rotten, especially when you have ONE number left and everyone gets all the prizes before you:

Cobblestones are quaint, but they ruined the wheels on one of my suitcases!

Dusk falls only by about 10.30 pm:

Prashanth treated me to dinner at "Yogi":

He had prawn Biryani, but the thought of the bill was apparently enough to prevent him from smiling:

But he smiled when I reminded him that we were celebrating his successful completion of both Halv-vattern (150 km) and the full Vatternrundan (300 km) on successive weekends!

We walked past this lovely seat on our way home:
