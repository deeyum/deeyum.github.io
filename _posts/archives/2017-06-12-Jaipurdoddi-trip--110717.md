What started out as a plan with 3 people rapidly developed into an outing with 15 other people! It was a very enjoyable outing to Ragihalli and then to Jaipurdoddi.Here they all are, at the MCS (Mandatory Chai Stop) where the group meet each other.

There was not much interaction  as we were driving through the reserve forests of Ragihalli and then Jaipurdoddi; but we all stopped at the Ragihalli sheet rock

The prehistoric dolmen, or burial site, can be seen. I often feel that even if I am not buried in this beautiful spot, my spirit is likely to be wandering around here!

Since there were two very young women, Akansha and Aadya, who were coming from quite far away (they were very punctual, too!) I woke up at 4 am to make

for everyone.

I served it with that most healthy of foods...potato chips! Everyone enjoyed it, to my delight.

As we drove to Jaipurdoddi, the rampant granite quarrying caught my eye once again and I hoped that our petitions to the government are fruitful in checking the depradation of our hillsides.

We stopped several times before reaching the reserve forest, and at one place, this Oriental Garden Lizard was hoping to catch some sun in the cloudy weather.

This particular tree, alone, at Jaipurdoddi, was replesendent in new foliage.

As the monsoon clouds cleared (we still do not have adequate rainfall), I saw this strange cloud formation...seems like a ear in the sky!

Tiny blue Evolvulus flowers grew along the ground.

I photographed very few birds, leaving them to the DSLR bazookas.

 Here's the Large Cuckooshrike:

An Oriental Honey Buzzard, surveying the territory for prey:

An Ashy Drongo:

A Black-rumped Flameback, amongst the bushes:

I call these two Spotted Owlets "Asleep" and "Awake"!

Aadya, who sketches what she observes, made this drawing of the Spotted Owlet, calling it James Bond!

This short stretch of the reserve forest is very scenic (with, alas, a terrible road!)

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86494503@N00/35213867266/in/album-72157681970673572/" title="IMG_4706"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4274/35213867266_791571db82.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_4706"></a>

The fleecy clouds and blue skies later dissolved into cloudy grey again.

Everywhere, Pavetta indica (Indian pavetta) bushes were in full bloom.

Here are some Vitex negundo (Medicinal nishad) flowers:

We wound up near the tiny lake just beyond the forest stretch, full of muddy water after the rains.

I caught some of the others standing in the shade of a beautiful Banyan.

Several butterflies kept all of us riveted for a while, watching and trying to capture them on camera.

I'm glad there are no dogs in the forest, or else Aadya and Akansha would have to stop for every one! Here they are petting one at a farmer's home.

We wound up with a thatte iddli brunch at Manjunath's Ragihalli Fine Dining.
