The photographs of KTB were sent by the other grandmother,  who's called "Nanna" and who lives in Portland, Maine. The grandparents had come over for her second birth anniversary (I had been there the previous two April 29's!) and I enjoyed the photographs they sent...


You can see that KTB is developing into a balanced personality...

Here she is, having birthday jelly with a little help!

She enjoys reading, whether with her dad...

Or by herself.

...You can see why she's called "Hurricane Hair"!


She enjoys wearing Indian clothes and bangles...

...and also a tutu and a headband, which was her uncle and aunt's (DS' brother and sister in law) birthday gift to her:

The TV behind her says, "baby hindustan" which was actually the name of a Morris Minor car! But then, KTB is half-a-hindustani baby!


Here's her mother showing her a photograph of a ballerina  on the laptop, though why the mother is looking so pained, I can't say.

She loves being with her Granddad :

And it's lovely to have a threesome photograph, under a convenient horse!
