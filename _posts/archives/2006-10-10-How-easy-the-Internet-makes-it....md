....

I LOVE both the audio, video and lyrics of this song by Madonna (very un-"Madonna" like at the time):

Years ago, I overtaped something over the video recording and hunted high and low...now all I need to do is to google (yes, it has become a generic verb now, <lj user="thaths">!) for it and there it is, the haunting images, the haunting words, the lovely music...

Well, apparently Madonna stole the video from Boy George, who then could sing, "This used to be my video..."...but I think her version is far better.

What a great thing the Internet is!
