We went to the Zoo today, as the weather was a balmy 4 deg C after a long spell of seriously sub-zero temperatures. One of the images that's stayed in my mind was a mother

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takin">TAKIN </a> 

(click on that to find out more about the animal...it's a Himalayan antelope/goat)

and her baby...you cannot mistake mother love anywhere...just look at the happiness on that kid's face!

Head-butting, too:

And on one of the concession stands, someone expressed a good sense of humour:
