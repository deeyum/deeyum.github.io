I'd decided to go for a brisk walk. NO birding, I'd promised myself. But I knew it was a hollow promise when I slung my camera around my neck! (well, even without the camera,I'd stop for any interesting bird or other creature...I knew it.) Like an addict who's determined to kick the addiction, I set off at a brisk pace.

For one hour, all went well. I turned my face resolutely from the Robins and the Grackles and the various Red-winged Blackbird pairs I saw. I walked up to the Prairie Area in Forest Park, and things started disintegrating as several flycatchers...Eastern Kingbirds, and Eastern Phoebes..made their appearance. I saw a Green Heron taking off, and resisted going after it to the Des Peres creek,where I knew it would go fishing. But as I walked home, along the conifers near Lindell Boulevard, I saw some Barn Swallows swooping along the grass, hawking insects. Then, I noticed one swallow going towards a little  blob on one of the conifers....I stopped in my tracks, my resolve forgotten, because this was a parent, feeding a fledgling...

sitting comfortably on the conifer branch, waiting for the parents to bring them food!

In between feedings, they'd preen:

But food took preference:

It was fascinating to watch the nursery meal in progress!

I dragged my reluctant feet off to go home, not realizing that another drama of a Red-tailed Hawk being mobbed by Robins and Grackles was going to grip me at the end of the walk! 

I've put up the photos on my FB album,
