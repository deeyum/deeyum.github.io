When the ground is covered with snow,
Where do the birds go?
When the earth is soaked with rain,
Where do the birds go for grain?
When the sun bakes the fields with its heat,
When the cracked earth burns our feet..
When the very air is hot and dry,
Where do the birds go...and why?
When the dusk deepens into twilight,
When rules the darkness of the night...
When no chink of light can show,
Where do the birds go?
We treat many people like the birds:
When they're with us, we have kind words.
But when with us they are not,
We do not give them a thought.
Where do the people go?
Where do the birds go?
