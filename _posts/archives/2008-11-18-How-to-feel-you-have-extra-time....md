<LJ user="amoghavarsha"> asked if I would come to Mydenahalli for the entire day today, to shoot the blackbuck. After much thought, I refused.

Now I realize this is a great way to feel that you have lots of extra time. Consider an activity which will keep you away for about 19 hours, and say no to it.

You feel so expansive about all the time you have saved, that you can afford to waste some of it, like I am doing right now, posting about it! :)

Heh, heh, maybe I have something artistic in me, after all....! In fact, I *did* try out something arty-farty this time:

OK,OK, butterflies post from the weekend coming up, once I trace the electrician, and chase the <strike> guy who is  sitting on my to-be-repaired TV for more than a month, like a mother hen on an infertile egg </strike> TV repair guy....
