I have been establishing contact with <LJ user="wild_guy">, because I like what he has been writing, a lot.... So we exchanged emails, and I got his mobile no. from his email, and called him up...and then asked him to send me an email. A somewhat surprised but polite rejoinder from him.

I am sitting here, looking at his email with a bright-red face. (Well, MY face turns purple, but you get the general idea...) 

HOW can I be SOOOO forgetful??? Well...the only reply is, I *can*. I confuse events, people, processes, dates, in fine and utter chaos.

Please...all of you...please understand that I am not scatterbrained, I am probably quarterbrained. 

The funny thing is, how I can remember SOME things perfectly well. My neighbour's car licence plate number (er, this was in 1972 or 1973!) was WBF 8084. My father in law's telephone number in Pondicherry was 23381. WOE ( 'What On Earth'...a polite variant of WTF.)....why can I remember such UZLISS bits of information and spend an hour hunting for my house keys, and then leave home without them?

Any of you who have fallen foul of this foul memory of mine...I apologize and apologize once again. Please do try to understand that my middle name is, and probably always has been, Alzheimer....


I even posted <a href="http://deponti.livejournal.com/201827.html"> This Verse </a>  about my memory once. It is not a joke.... as they say in the Orbit Chewing Gum ad, "it is a TRUE!!"
