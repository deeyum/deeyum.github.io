Prior to getting onto Facebook, my only online presence had been my Livejournal, but since then, my visits to my blog have sharply tapered off. Now, I visit my LJ, only when I need to make a post that I want to be able to share with friends outside of Facebook, and if I think I want to be able to find it, a few weeks or months later. In 2013, I started renting the use of a Linux server, to contribute to community computing, and thought that it would also give me an option to setup my own blog/CMS and move away from LJ, but that didn't quite happen, until now. In the meanwhile, my workplace switched to Jekyll, to power its website, it sure was impressive! For a guy who likes things simple, and doesn't relish slaving on stylesheets, it seemed very enticing. I spent a little time online, and before long, I was on my way to getting this up and running. I'm still not at the point where my LJ is fully migrated and ready for the pulling of the plug, but I can see it happening sometime in the near future.
