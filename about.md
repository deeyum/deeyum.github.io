I'm a developer and Linux Sysadmin, with over ten years of experience and keen interest in grid and cluster computing, and information security.
I live in Sweden, and work at the National Supercomputer Center, in Link√∂ping. 
You can find my resume [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

# Community Computing Initiative

Since 2013, I've been contributing compute cycles to projects from <a href="http://worldcommunitygrid.org">World Community Grid</a>. If you are interested to know more, or looking to get started, <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a> is a good place to start.
